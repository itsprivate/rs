This is perfect for any newbie trying to understand what is going on and how the system has ended up the way it has.</p>\n\n<p>Tl;Dr at end.</p>\n\n<p>There are many great DD&#39;s that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. <strong>However while looking around for DTCC ownership</strong> and after having found <a href=\"http://theoildrum.com/special/archives\">The Oil Drum</a> (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), <strong>Cede and co</strong> which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago <strong>(credit:</strong> <a href=\"/u/bEAc0n\">u/bEAc0n</a>) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.</p>\n\n<p>This website is run by a <strong>dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income</strong> and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.</p>\n\n<p>I sent him an email and this was his response</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thanks for the kind words.  </p>\n\n<p>No problem with your request. Here is the link you should give them.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://smithonstocks.com/?s=illegal+naked+shorting\">https://smithonstocks.com/?s=illegal+naked+shorting</a> (This is Part 10)  </p>\n\n<p>If there is any movement formed to take on illegal naked shorting, I would be happy to contribute.

Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. <strong>At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m14jye/a_10_part_series_that_will_clearly_explain_what/","title":"A 10 part series that will clearly explain what is going on with Naked Shorting in Stock Market","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-09T15:41:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-09 15:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m14jye","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m14jye/a_10_part_series_that_will_clearly_explain_what/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m14jye/a_10_part_series_that_will_clearly_explain_what/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Tepllhcgftwhdg","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tepllhcgftwhdg","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Tepllhcgftwhdg","score":5092,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"一个10部分的系列，将清楚地解释什么是赤裸裸地在股市做空","the_new_excerpt":"把你的锡箔纸帽子拿出来，它的时间来看看你认为你想看到的，但。\n不真的想。这对于任何一个新手来说都是完美的，他们想了解什么是\n是怎么回事，以及如何系统已经结束的方式。\n\nTl;Dr在最后。\n\n有很多伟大的DD，清楚地解释了裸空的3... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個10部分的系列，將清楚地解釋什麼是赤裸裸地在股市做空","the_new_excerpt":"把你的錫箔紙帽子拿出來，它的時間來看看你認爲你想看到的，但。\n不真的想。這對於任何一個新手來說都是完美的，他們想了解什麼是\n是怎麼回事，以及如何系統已經結束的方式。\n\nTl;Dr在最後。\n\n有很多偉大的DD，清楚地解釋了裸空的3... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m16emz","excerpt":"This thread will be automatically stickied weekdays at 8:30am, and unstickied at\n9:15am.\n\nMegathreads are now posted automatically based on a few factors, including:\n\n * Mentions by comment count, weighted by comment novelty and score\n * Accounts of users mentioning, weighted by age, posting…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m16emz/gme_megathread_for_march_09_2021/","title":"GME Megathread for March 09, 2021","date":"March 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2021年3月9日的全球环境监测系统Megathread。","the_new_excerpt":"此主题将在工作日上午8:30自动贴上，并在以下时间取消贴上\n上午9点15分\n\nMegathreads现在会根据一些因素自动发布，包括。\n\n * 根据评论数量，按评论的新颖性和得分加权的提及量\n * 用户提及的账户，按年龄加权，发帖...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年3月9日的全球環境監測系統Megathread。","the_new_excerpt":"此主題將在工作日上午8:30自動貼上，並在以下時間取消貼上\n上午9點15分\n\nMegathreads現在會根據一些因素自動發佈，包括。\n\n * 根據評論數量，按評論的新穎性和得分加權的提及量\n * 用戶提及的賬戶，按年齡加權，發帖...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m15akr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m15akr/get_ready_boys_were_coming_back_fo_yall_no_retard/","title":"Get ready boys.. we’re coming back fo y’all , no retard left behind!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 09, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"准备好了，伙计们... 我们会回来的，没有弱智留下！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"準備好了，夥計們... 我們會回來的，沒有弱智留下！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m14jye","previousId":"RedditPost-m16emz","nextId":"RedditPost-m15akr","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m14jye/a_10_part_series_that_will_clearly_explain_what/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
