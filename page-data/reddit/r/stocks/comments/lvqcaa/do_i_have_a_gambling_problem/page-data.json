However, in the last year I’ve gotten really into swing trading because of the bull market (always afraid to let my money sit in an ETF for fear of a major correction). Ive justified it as being something controllable as I can make educated decisions based on charts/financials/news and not a pure gamble that’s out of my hands.</p>\n\n<p>However, trading has consumed my life. I spend all my time reading charts and news. It has really started to impact my family and work life. I can step away from trading but I hate the thought of having my money sit and do nothing or the risk aversion in me is afraid of letting my funds sit in an ETF with an impending crash/correction. So I’m in this position where I know it’s affecting my life but I can’t step away from potential gains. That’s when I started questioning- do I have a gambling problem?</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone else have this experience?
