Not a time to act...yet. One suggestion I offer to everyone, and it is something I do myself: I keep about 15% of my portfolio in BRKB at all times. I added tremendously in last year’s ~175 range, and have dealt with questioning and at times outright ridicule as to why I would sideline a significant portion of my portfolio when it has under performed the s&amp;p500 for the last 15 years.</p>\n\n<p>I also keep 10-20% in VOO. Another 40% is spread out among ETFs, and the remainder home run swings. But I want to focus on precisely why Berkshire Hathaway is such a valuable investment vehicle so that many of you can consider it in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Now is not the time to buy. Once all of this blows over and people are back to fetishizing growth, there may be some great entry opportunities. But it should not be looked at as purchasing an individual stock—instead you are buying a mindset toward diversifying amongst value assets. It’s insurance giant that diversifies on a time-tested philosophy and acts as insurance for your portfolio. Since I added back last year it’s up 40%+ and is carrying my portfolio through the turmoil. You don’t even have to own a lot to make it a winner. But when the market acts like this it really makes things easier psychologically.</p>\n\n<p>There are concerns, of course. Warren isn’t going to live forever, and the company has been hesitant to capitalize on some major opportunities. But I imagine they may make some moves here that we will hear about later on if value presents itself. And the succession plan has been meticulously considered, just as Buffett’s investments are.</p>\n\n<p>But anyway—plug for a company that is boring and overlooked, but run by guys who get this stuff better than all of us combined.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Oh to add—I also manage my mom’s portfolio. About 50% is in BRKB, 25% VOO, and 25% in VGT+VCR. She’s unfazed by the dip, may even be up now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lyhye6/berkshire_hathaway/","title":"Berkshire Hathaway","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-06T06:38:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-06 06:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lyhye6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lyhye6/berkshire_hathaway/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lyhye6/berkshire_hathaway/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"bro8619","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bro8619","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bro8619","score":49,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"伯克希尔哈撒韦","the_new_excerpt":"现在是学习、呼吸、观察和计划的时候。现在还不是行动的时候......。一...\n我提供给大家的建议，也是我自己做的事情。我保持着\n我的投资组合中始终有15%在BRKB。我在去年大幅增加了\n~175范围内，并曾处理过质疑，有时... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"伯克希爾哈撒韋","the_new_excerpt":"現在是學習、呼吸、觀察和計劃的時候。現在還不是行動的時候......。一...\n我提供給大家的建議，也是我自己做的事情。我保持着\n我的投資組合中始終有15%在BRKB。我在去年大幅增加了\n~175範圍內，並曾處理過質疑，有時... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lyskcg","excerpt":"\"Tesla finished below $600 for the first time since Dec. 4, and has lost 15% on\nthe year.\n\nThe sell-off comes amidst a bigger drawback in tech stocks, which are valued\nbased on the presumption of heavy growth in future cash flows.\n\nCompetition and parts shortages are also playing a part.\n\nShares…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lyskcg/tesla_closes_below_600_for_the_first_time_since/","title":"Tesla closes below $600 for the first time since December","date":"March 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉自12月以来首次收于600美元以下。","the_new_excerpt":"\"自12月4日以来，特斯拉首次收盘跌破600美元，已跌去15%。\n年的。\n\n抛售的同时，科技股也出现了较大的回落，科技股的估值为\n基于未来现金流大量增长的假设。\n\n竞争和零部件短缺也在发挥作用。\n\n股...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉自12月以來首次收於600美元以下。","the_new_excerpt":"\"自12月4日以來，特斯拉首次收盤跌破600美元，已跌去15%。\n年的。\n\n拋售的同時，科技股也出現了較大的回落，科技股的估值爲\n基於未來現金流大量增長的假設。\n\n競爭和零部件短缺也在發揮作用。\n\n股...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1367833130204344320","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367833130204344320","title":"From the bottom last March:\n\nEnergy stocks +131%\n\nTech stocks +79% https://t.co/fd50ZVwYgU","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"从去年3月的底部。\n\n能源股+131%\n\n科技股+79% https://t.co/fd50ZVwYgU","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"從去年3月的底部。\n\n能源股+131%\n\n科技股+79% https://t.co/fd50ZVwYgU","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lyhye6","previousId":"RedditPost-lyskcg","nextId":"TweetPost-1367833130204344320","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lyhye6/berkshire_hathaway/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
