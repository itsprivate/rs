Initial Asia supply chain builds for iPhone 13 are in the 100-million-unit range compared to the firm&#39;s initial iPhone 12 reads of 80 million, he added.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;While this number will clearly move around over the coming months, we believe this speaks to an increased confidence with Cook &amp; Co. that this 5G driven product cycle will extend well into 2022 and should also benefit from a post-vaccine consumer &quot;reopening environment,&quot; Ives wrote in the note.</p>\n\n<p>The iPhone 13 will likely have a 1 terabyte storage option, double that of the current highest Pro storage capacity, the analyst said. It will also include a number of enhancements, with Lidar across all iPhone 13 models.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the iPhone 13 could be a &quot;game changer&quot; indicating the supercycle party in Cupertino is going well in 2022.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AAPL Price Action:</strong> At last check, Apple shares were rising 5.22% to $127.59.</p>\n\n<h3>Latest Ratings for AAPL</h3>\n\n<p><strong>DateFirmActionFromTo</strong></p>\n\n<p>Feb 2021RBC Capital Assumes Outperform</p>\n\n<p>Jan 2021DA Davidson Maintains Buy</p>\n\n<p>Jan 2021 Deutsche Bank Maintains Buy</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/03/19914271/why-apples-iphone-13-could-be-a-game-changer-with-1tb-storage-option-lidar\">https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/03/19914271/why-apples-iphone-13-could-be-a-game-changer-with-1tb-storage-option-lidar</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/users/shanthi-rexaline\">Shanthi Rexaline</a> , Benzinga Staff Writer</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lvjpj5/why_apples_iphone_13_could_be_a_game_changer_with/","title":"Why Apple's iPhone 13 Could Be A 'Game Changer' With 1TB Storage Option, Lidar 12-month price target of $175, with the bull-case $225","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T23:52:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 23:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvjpj5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lvjpj5/why_apples_iphone_13_could_be_a_game_changer_with/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lvjpj5/why_apples_iphone_13_could_be_a_game_changer_with/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"folkwoodswest","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/folkwoodswest","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"folkwoodswest","score":73,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么苹果iPhone 13可能成为 \"游戏改变者\"，1TB存储选项，利达12个月目标价175美元，牛市225美元。","the_new_excerpt":"随着苹果公司AAPL 5.08%的发布，启动了iPhone的超级周期。\n[https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ] iPhone 12\n[https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/11/18468357/how-consumers-are-reacting-to-apples-iphone-12-lineup]\n将可能持续到2022年，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼蘋果iPhone 13可能成爲 \"遊戲改變者\"，1TB存儲選項，利達12個月目標價175美元，牛市225美元。","the_new_excerpt":"隨着蘋果公司AAPL 5.08%的發佈，啓動了iPhone的超級週期。\n[https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ] iPhone 12\n[https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/11/18468357/how-consumers-are-reacting-to-apples-iphone-12-lineup]\n將可能持續到2022年，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1366493871321079813","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366493871321079813","title":"The markets are closed. \n \n✧ S&amp;P 500 △ 2.38%                   \n✧ Nasdaq △ 3.01%              \n✧ Russell 2K △ 3.37%                   \n✧ Dow Jones △ 1.95% https://t.co/olQQgueCIR","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"市场是关闭的。\n \n✧ S&amp;P 500 △ 2.38%。                  \n✧ 纳斯达克 △ 3.01%。             \n✧ 罗素2K △ 3.37%。                  \n✧ 道琼斯 △ 1.95% https://t.co/olQQgueCIR","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"市場是關閉的。\n \n✧ S&amp;P 500 △ 2.38%。                  \n✧ 納斯達克 △ 3.01%。             \n✧ 羅素2K △ 3.37%。                  \n✧ 道瓊斯 △ 1.95% https://t.co/olQQgueCIR","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lvkqmu","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvkqmu/which_one_of_you_beautiful_dipshits_bought_127/","title":"Which one of you beautiful dipshits bought $12.7 mil of GME after hours","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你们哪位美女笨蛋在盘后买了1270万美元的GME？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們哪位美女笨蛋在盤後買了1270萬美元的GME？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lvjpj5","previousId":"TweetPost-1366493871321079813","nextId":"RedditPost-lvkqmu","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lvjpj5/why_apples_iphone_13_could_be_a_game_changer_with/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
