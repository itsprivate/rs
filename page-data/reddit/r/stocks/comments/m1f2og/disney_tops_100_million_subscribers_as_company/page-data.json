We knew this was coming, but either way it’s good news. The subscribers have come in extreme pace thanks to their good content. Bob Chapek even stated in the article that they’ll be providing 100+ new titles per year.   Chapek also stated that they are aiming to open their California theme parks by the end of April. Disney will release more info on this in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<p>With the parks reopening and Disney+ aiming towards a subscriber target of 230-260 million by the end of FY2024, the company’s future hasn’t looked brighter than ever before.
