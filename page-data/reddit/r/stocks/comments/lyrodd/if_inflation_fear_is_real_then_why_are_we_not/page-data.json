We all know inflation will be higher than usual since Feds has been printing money for a year now and why only until recently does people start to take action on inflation risk? Sure bond market has a bearish outlook on the economy but why would some of the obvious inflation hedge like gold or Bitcoin are also down over the past month then. And JPOW’s remarks on future interest rate and inflation rate are very positive and no one seems to believe him. </p>\n\n<p>Some of you argue that the market is switching over to bonds because it reaches year high. I mean bond yield is still at historical lows. I think this is just a cyclical rotation and some profit taking and a normal market correction as we’ve seen back in September of last year. Just relax and keep buying the dips. AMD sub-80 or AMZN sub 3000 is an absolute steal now.
