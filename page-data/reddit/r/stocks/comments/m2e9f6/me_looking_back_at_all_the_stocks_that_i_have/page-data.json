Almost all of which that I have owned for a short period or was serious considering buying but didn&#39;t do it for some reason. There&#39;s a few others stocks but these are the most notable ones. Other stocks I wanted and had were SAVE, LUV, CCL, DAL, IMAX.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the point I have is that I listened to people too much and I overthought stocks. I may have sold stocks on emotions too. I also never expected for stocks to rise so high so fast. Yes, I still made money but nowhere near as much as I could have. I had multiple opportunities and I didn&#39;t take them. Now I&#39;m stuck in a position where I don&#39;t want to buy anything because everything is crazy high.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m2e9f6/me_looking_back_at_all_the_stocks_that_i_have/","title":"Me looking back at all the stocks that I have owned a year ago","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-11T05:52:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-11 05:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m2e9f6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2e9f6/me_looking_back_at_all_the_stocks_that_i_have/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2e9f6/me_looking_back_at_all_the_stocks_that_i_have/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"73hebdhyd6h36dhld","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/73hebdhyd6h36dhld","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"73hebdhyd6h36dhld","score":105,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我回顾一年前拥有的所有股票。","the_new_excerpt":"https://imgur.com/XsDbjZm\n\n这么多机会错过了。在GRWG升到60级之前，我一直对W很不感冒。\n这让我从22.5K的10K收益看起来很糟糕，其中大部分都是来自于一个。\n股票。\n\n如果你因为某些原因看不到图片，问题股票是：grwg，se。\ntsla，W，nvax，蛋糕，......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我回顧一年前擁有的所有股票。","the_new_excerpt":"https://imgur.com/XsDbjZm\n\n這麼多機會錯過了。在GRWG升到60級之前，我一直對W很不感冒。\n這讓我從22.5K的10K收益看起來很糟糕，其中大部分都是來自於一個。\n股票。\n\n如果你因爲某些原因看不到圖片，問題股票是：grwg，se。\ntsla，W，nvax，蛋糕，......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m23u4x","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m23u4x/gme_trade_halting_right_now/","title":"GME trade halting right now","date":"March 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME贸易现在停止","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME貿易現在停止","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m2cwjy","excerpt":"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is exploring how it can meet rising customer demand to\nown and invest in bitcoin, while still staying on the right side of regulation,\nbank President and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron said on Wednesday.\n\n“Client demand is rising,” Waldron said. “We are regulated on…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m2cwjy/goldman_sachs_coo_reports_clients_demand_for/","title":"Goldman Sachs COO Reports Clients’ Demand for Bitcoin is Rising","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 11, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"高盛首席运营官报告称客户对比特币的需求正在上升。","the_new_excerpt":"高盛集团（Goldman Sachs Group Inc.）正在探索如何满足客户日益增长的需求，以实现。\n拥有和投资比特币，同时还能保持在监管的正确性。\n银行总裁兼首席运营官John Waldron周三表示。\n\n\"客户需求正在上升，\"Waldron说。\"我们是在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"高盛首席運營官報告稱客戶對比特幣的需求正在上升。","the_new_excerpt":"高盛集團（Goldman Sachs Group Inc.）正在探索如何滿足客戶日益增長的需求，以實現。\n擁有和投資比特幣，同時還能保持在監管的正確性。\n銀行總裁兼首席運營官John Waldron週三表示。\n\n\"客戶需求正在上升，\"Waldron說。\"我們是在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m2e9f6","previousId":"RedditPost-m23u4x","nextId":"RedditPost-m2cwjy","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m2e9f6/me_looking_back_at_all_the_stocks_that_i_have/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
