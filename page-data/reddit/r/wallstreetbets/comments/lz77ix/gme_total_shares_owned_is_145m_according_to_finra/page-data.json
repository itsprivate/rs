So they&#39;re basically increasing the share volume and covering their earlier shorts without paying a dime so that it doesn&#39;t cause eF-T-D. They could technically do this infinitely unless maybe government regulations intervenes?</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if the price drops, just hold your shares, you don&#39;t need to buy, you need to HOLD OR PLACE A SELL ORDER FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT YOU WANT TO SELL $1000+, $100,000+, whatever you want. The share price may drop (even if they continue doing ladder attacks) but the moment they start buying from the actual shareholders again, the price will rise extremely fast. If we all want to sell at $1000 then it will rise to $1000 immediately, it&#39;s just whatever an actual shareholder wants to sell at. And proof is in the pudding that majority only want to buy or hold.</p>\n\n<p>YOU CAN BUY OR NOT BUY. IT DOESN&#39;T MATTER EITHER WAY, WE STILL CHOOSE OUR SELLING PRICE. If we stop buying then eF-T-D kicks in and they have to buy back shares at whatever price we want. If we keep buying then also that&#39;s good but just means it&#39;s a longer game and the pressure is going to be worse for them unless government or DTCC intervenes and forces them to close. Also worst case scenario for this whole thing is if hedgies do go bankrupt from this or Failure-To-Deliver and fined, then we still get our money from <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/quadrillion-dollar-corporation-at-the-heart-of-the-financial-system-20150707-gi6w7b\">clearing party</a>/broker. Basically we are win/win, set your desired sell price.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Ape stonk ü¶ßüöÄüöÄüåöüçåüçåüçå Shares are heavily shorted and increasing. If you sell at a loss you&#39;re defo a paper hand! Do your DD, Finra needs to write their data inputs properly. Good luck at the casino!</p>\n\n<p><sup>I have to write eF-T-D to stop post being banned by ticker...</sup></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz77ix/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra/","title":"GME total shares owned is 145M+ according to FINRA.
