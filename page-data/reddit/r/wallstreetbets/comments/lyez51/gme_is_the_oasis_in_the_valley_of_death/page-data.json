Was up to $8,000 on Cciv from my initial investment of $2250 then these cuck scumbags announced after Robin Hood closed(fuck Robin Hood btw.) and I woke up to $38/share and took my $2k profit and jerked off with my said tears thinking about $8000. Then I picked myself up and told myself don’t worry about it, there’s more to be made. Now look at this fucking market it’s a red sand desert and GME is the fucking oasis. Here I am now. Either way, why play fair when the deck is stacked so high for the hedge funds and Wall Street. I’m holding, there are two outcomes here. We win and the world is right, we lose and this is not a market I want to invest in because I wasn’t born into a rich family so I’m not allowed to get rich. Fucking yolo, I apologize for my past transgressions GME it is the way. I won’t be drinking any piss, or getting any tattoos, not gonna suck any farts out of my wife’s boyfriends ass.....but I like the stock.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyez51/gme_is_the_oasis_in_the_valley_of_death/","title":"GME is the oasis in the valley of death","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T20:30:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 20:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lyez51","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyez51/gme_is_the_oasis_in_the_valley_of_death/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyez51/gme_is_the_oasis_in_the_valley_of_death/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Remote_Winner_8192","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Remote_Winner_8192","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Remote_Winner_8192","score":5518,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME是死亡谷中的绿洲。","the_new_excerpt":"我只是跑了3000美元到GME这是我所有的股票，我试图使\n钱的干净和公平的方式。是在Cciv上高达8000美元，从我最初的。\n投资2250美元，然后这些王八蛋在罗宾汉之后宣布。\n收盘(去他妈的罗宾汉。)，我醒来时，38元/股，拿着我的2千块钱......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME是死亡谷中的綠洲。","the_new_excerpt":"我只是跑了3000美元到GME這是我所有的股票，我試圖使\n錢的乾淨和公平的方式。是在Cciv上高達8000美元，從我最初的。\n投資2250美元，然後這些王八蛋在羅賓漢之後宣佈。\n收盤(去他媽的羅賓漢。)，我醒來時，38元/股，拿着我的2千塊錢......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ly92v9","excerpt":"The familiar \"Rate My Portfolio\" sticky can be found here.\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Arate+my+portfolio&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome traders who just can't help…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ly92v9/rstocks_daily_thread_on_meme_stocks_friday_mar_05/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Thread on Meme Stocks Friday - Mar 05, 2021","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks每日主题：Meme Stocks周五--2021年3月5日。","the_new_excerpt":"熟悉的 \"给我的投资组合评分 \"贴纸可以在这里找到。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Arate+my+portfolio&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n欢迎那些只是忍不住的贸易商...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/Stocks每日主題：Meme Stocks週五--2021年3月5日。","the_new_excerpt":"熟悉的 \"給我的投資組合評分 \"貼紙可以在這裏找到。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Arate+my+portfolio&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n歡迎那些只是忍不住的貿易商...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lyd1h8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyd1h8/discussion_so_far_this_morning_gme_retains_the/","title":"Discussion so far this morning: GME retains the lead in mentions","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"今天上午至今的讨论。GME保持着领先的提及率","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天上午至今的討論。GME保持着領先的提及率","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lyez51","previousId":"RedditPost-ly92v9","nextId":"RedditPost-lyd1h8","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyez51/gme_is_the_oasis_in_the_valley_of_death/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
