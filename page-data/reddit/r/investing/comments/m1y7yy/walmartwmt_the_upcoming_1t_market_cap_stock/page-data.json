Thousands of sellers from that platform would join in Walmart Marketplace, which would help increase traffic and generate more revenue from fees and selling its own product.</li>\n<li>Walmart is speculated to open some forms of banking service which will help bank the millions of unbanked in USA.</li>\n<li>Walmart&#39;s partnership with Instacart and ThreadUp will help it create a dominating position in the online grocery market for the former partnership and a good positioning for high end clothes for the latter partnership.</li>\n<li>Walmart&#39;s positioning in India through Flipkart was a genius deal in hindsight. This is only the beginning for the Indian market so we can expect huge growth in Flipkart. There could be a time where Flipkart could become the most important part of Walmart.</li>\n<li>Walmart&#39;s expansion in Africa and China is also noticeable.</li>\n<li>My own DCF estimates point out that Walmart is at least 10% off from its fair value, without taking most of the growth factors out of the equation(mostly, due to them being incredibly hard to actually give a value) and using fairly conservative estimates.</li>\n<li>Walmart+(recently launched) and Sam&#39;s Club could have a further good impact on its bottom line.</li>\n<li>Recent venture by Walmart to launch a fintech startup shows that management is hungry for growth. They are also launching it just like a startup.</li>\n<li>Walmart&#39;s management has shown good competency unlike most of the companies at this stage as a business. They are integrating various services somewhat like Amazon and this is very bullish.</li>\n<li>There is the possibility of multiple expansion in Walmart.</li>\n<li>Walmart is also setting up for more automation in its supply chain. And this will ultimately reduce cost and increase its margin.</li>\n<li>Lotto ticket case. Walmart cancels its dividends and says they are focusing on growth and are a tech company.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Bear case</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The various expansions and investments Walmart is making is very expensive in their very nature so one might say this is negative if they fail to succeed in their ventures.</li>\n<li>Raising of minimum wage will also impact its bottom line(although I tried to take that into account in my valuation).</li>\n<li>Redditors with huge disposable income may not like Walmart as a company because of moral relativism and herd mentality.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m1y7yy/walmartwmt_the_upcoming_1t_market_cap_stock/","title":"Walmart(WMT): The upcoming $1T market cap stock","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-10T17:07:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-10 17:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m1y7yy","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m1y7yy/walmartwmt_the_upcoming_1t_market_cap_stock/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m1y7yy/walmartwmt_the_upcoming_1t_market_cap_stock/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"nafizzaki","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nafizzaki","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"nafizzaki","score":187,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"沃尔玛(WMT)。即将到来的1T市值的股票","the_new_excerpt":"牛市案例\n\n 1.
