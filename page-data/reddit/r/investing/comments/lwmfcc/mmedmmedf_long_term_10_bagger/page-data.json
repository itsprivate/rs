Not sure how many people are familiar with the psychedelic space, but I’m here to tell you guys a bit about mindmed and the space as a whole. </p>\n\n<p>The basic investment thesis is this: current available mental health treatments such as adderall, Xanax, suboxone, etc simply dull out, or put a temporary bandaid on the issue. After looking at the efficacy rates for issues such as smoking cessation, PTSD, treatment resistant depression, etc, it is clear that psychedelics could turn into a massive industry that disrupts the way we treat mental health. This could lead mind medicine and other similar companies to multi billion dollar buyouts from big pharma companies. </p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of fantastic companies in the space, but mindmed is by far my favourite. For full disclosure I’m currently long ~100k warrants, already up bigly. </p>\n\n<p>Mindmed has a diverse pipeline for a multitude of issues, plenty of cash for future R&amp;D, and plenty of fantastic partnerships in academia/pharma. Additionally, this stock cannot be traded yet by anyone on robinhood due to it being on the OTC market. A nasdaq uplist (expected) would open the floodgates to a ton of new retail buyers. There is also EXTREMELY low institutional ownership, basically 0%. </p>\n\n<p>At a market cap of 1.5 billion Canadian dollars, this can easily be a 10 bagger once there is more media attention surrounding it, and more progress is made regarding clinical trials. People are not talking about the psychedelic space yet. </p>\n\n<p>Last thing before I start seeing this in the comments, this does NOT at all compare to the weed industry. There are far more barriers to entry, addresses a totally different market (recreational vs medicinal), and has the added advantage of interest from big pharma.</p>\n\n<p>I’m aware this isn’t very detailed or anything, I don’t have the patience to put together a full DD post. I’m simply encouraging everyone in this group to do consider what this company has going for it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lwmfcc/mmedmmedf_long_term_10_bagger/","title":"MMED/MMEDF - long term 10+ bagger","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-03T08:29:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-03 08:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwmfcc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lwmfcc/mmedmmedf_long_term_10_bagger/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lwmfcc/mmedmmedf_long_term_10_bagger/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"JR_Rahn_ismyfather","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JR_Rahn_ismyfather","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"JR_Rahn_ismyfather","score":130,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"MMED/MMEDF----长期10年以上装袋机。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。不知道有多少人熟知迷幻的?\n空间，但我在这里要告诉你们一些关于mindmed和空间作为一个。\n整体。\n\n基本的投资论点是：目前现有的心理健康治疗手段\n如阿德拉、Xanax、suboxone等简单枯燥，或... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"MMED/MMEDF----長期10年以上裝袋機。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。不知道有多少人熟知迷幻的?\n空間，但我在這裏要告訴你們一些關於mindmed和空間作爲一個。\n整體。\n\n基本的投資論點是：目前現有的心理健康治療手段\n如阿德拉、Xanax、suboxone等簡單枯燥，或... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1366888495722213379","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366888495722213379","title":"US National Debt moves above $28 trillion for the first time, increasing $4.6 trillion over the last year. https://t.co/IkhSWw209B","date":"March 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国国债首次突破28万亿美元 去年增加4.6万亿美元https://t.co/IkhSWw209B。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國國債首次突破28萬億美元 去年增加4.6萬億美元https://t.co/IkhSWw209B。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lwkrr8","excerpt":"So airbnb just opened public last December, and since then I've been lucky to\nbuy shares at all the dips and have actually made quite a bit of money (knock on\nwood) Once people start traveling again (and the people are travel hungry) I\nthink airbnb is going to dominate the market.
