Most are in the realm of a 0.1% tax on equities and bonds and a smaller tax on derivatives.  The estimated revenue from this tax varies based on who you ask, somewhere between a few hundred billion to upwards of 1 trillion over a decade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Securities Transaction Taxes and Market Quality</strong> studies the transaction tax levied in NY in the bulk of the 1900s. It&#39;s interesting in that it studies the same market as the proposed tax, but the NY tax was local and had a side effect of pushing volumes to other venues (AMEX) which wouldn&#39;t occur in a national STT.

When there was no alternative (NYSE or don&#39;t trade), 4/9 cases had a statistically significant reduction in volume while 5/9 were not statistically significant in either direction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Generally, the study found that STTs have an inverse relationship with market quality.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Securities Transactions Taxes and Financial Markets</strong> published by the IMF is a somewhat more general paper, but for a period focuses on Sweden’s experiment with STTs for about eight years.
