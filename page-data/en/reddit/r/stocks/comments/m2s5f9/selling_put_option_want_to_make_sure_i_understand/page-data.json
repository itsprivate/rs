Isn&#39;t the point to learn trading option from knowledgeable people I don&#39;t get it? Anyhow, maybe someone here can reassure me.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve gotten a bit more comfortable with basic options trading over the past 6 months. I still consider selling a put option a basic task but very important to add to the repertoire for setting up more complex strategies. I want to start getting more comfortable with this type of trade as well. I want to keep the first one small just to make sure I don&#39;t screw it up or lose a bunch of money. I&#39;ll outline the trade below and just want to make sure there&#39;s no huge potential for loss here.</p>\n\n<p>I want to own Palantir (PLTR) at $23.5, it is currently trading at $26. My assumption is that I can sell the put option (sell to open) contract for a strike price of $23.5 for whatever date I choose (looking short term just to start off - say April 1). If the price of PLTR drops to $23.5 at any point during that period and gets executed, I am assigned the shares at the strike price of $23.5 (minus the premium I receive so actually less than $23.5 overall). If it never hits the strike price of $23.5, the contract expires I get no shares but I collect the premium. Am I missing something on this that might cost me a bunch of money? I know that I need to ensure I have the capitol in my portfolio to cover the cost of the contract if it gets executed, that&#39;s not an issue. But my concern is my Brokerage states my maximum loss potential is $2,239 which scares me. I&#39;m assuming that the $2,239 loss is actually just the cost for purchasing the shares minus the premium received, but that to me is not a loss I still own an underlying equity worth $2350 (i.e. no loss).  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m2s5f9/selling_put_option_want_to_make_sure_i_understand/","title":"Selling put option, want to make sure I understand the risks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-11T18:54:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-11 18:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m2s5f9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2s5f9/selling_put_option_want_to_make_sure_i_understand/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2s5f9/selling_put_option_want_to_make_sure_i_understand/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"calipfarris01","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/calipfarris01","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"calipfarris01","score":82,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"卖出认沽期权，想确定我是否了解风险。","the_new_excerpt":"试图在r/Options [/r/Options]中发布这个帖子，但作为一个新的交易者被删除。\n的问题。是不是要向有识之士学习交易期权，我\n不明白吗？总之，也许这里有人能让我放心。\n\n在过去的6年里，我对基本期权交易有了更多的了解。\n几个月。I…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"賣出認沽期權，想確定我是否瞭解風險。","the_new_excerpt":"試圖在r/Options [/r/Options]中發佈這個帖子，但作爲一個新的交易者被刪除。\n的問題。是不是要向有識之士學習交易期權，我\n不明白嗎？總之，也許這裏有人能讓我放心。\n\n在過去的6年裏，我對基本期權交易有了更多的瞭解。\n幾個月。I…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m2s8x9","excerpt":"Shanthi Rexaline [https://www.benzinga.com/users/shanthi-rexaline] , Benzinga\nStaff Writer\n\nApple Inc.
