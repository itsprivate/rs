Investors’ high  expectations from these results could help its stock recover during the  month. </p>\n\n<p>In the year 2020, we saw how the rising demand for EVs drove a massive rally in many companies’ shares (like <strong>Tesla</strong>),  despite the global pandemic. Experts predict the 2020s to be the decade  of EVs, smart mobility, and autonomous cars. Investing in companies  focusing on these top emerging trends of the decade could be a great  idea to get rich.
