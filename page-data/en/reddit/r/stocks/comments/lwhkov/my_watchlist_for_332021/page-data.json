Very low risk play here, all indicators are super low, it is looking prime.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$COR  - Again, crashing right into support - so let&#39;s wait for some sign of life. Indicators are all low which is also good.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$CTSO - Testing the 200EMA at old resistance, which is great. All indicators are all low as well which is good!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$ERIE - This channel up is sexual. Earnings seems to have been survived, but 200EMA, support, and trend up here. Indicators all low looking good for a continuation.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$HRTX - Great value, support, and 200EMA right above it so we should wait. Looking real tasty. Indicators are all low here.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$IAA  - Support, trend up, and 200EMA are all right here holding it up. Indicators are low which is good too!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$NI   - Great value on this descending triangle but it has fairly low reward, but super low risk. Indicators are low, but RSI is just fair.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$RNG  - Bouncing off the 200EMA, support, and possible trend up here. Looking real good!
