It just bounced off the 200EMA at $34, and it making its way up to the 50MA at $53. There&#39;s a big gap between those prices, and NIO could bounce around between $40 and $44 before deciding which way to go.</p>\n\n<p>There are bull and bear cases for NIO in the short term. They have announced recent strong partnerships with manufacturing companies and are building more factories to expand their deliveries. They also are releasing new vehicles and have announced tech partnerships for autonomous driving.  But they are affected by the chip shortage that is ravaging the auto market. And they are also facing tremendous competition in China and abroad from TSLA and VOW for their mid-size SUVs.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re holding NIO, it would be a good time to start hedging. Either selling covered calls at 0.25 delta (around $53) or buying long dated puts. I would suggest $30 puts for May 21 which are sitting at $2.00 right now. Paying $200 for downside protection given that NIO may fall to $28 which is the October support level below the 200MA is a reasonable ask. If it does fall, I suspect NIO will fall hard and fast, allowing the PUT to help absorb some of the loss potential.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, this is just some cautious advice given some warning signs that are flashing. I think NIO is a winner long term, but 2021 may be a tough year where the gains made in 2020 may level out and even recede until more reliable results are provided by NIO.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m2g3ub/nio_testing_200ma_threat_of_falling_through_to/","title":"NIO testing 200MA, threat of falling through to October support levels","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-11T06:47:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-11 06:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m2g3ub","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2g3ub/nio_testing_200ma_threat_of_falling_through_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2g3ub/nio_testing_200ma_threat_of_falling_through_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"radarbot","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/radarbot","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"radarbot","score":69,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"NIO测试200MA，恐跌穿10月支撑位","the_new_excerpt":"NIO现在正处于一个非常有趣和危险的拐点。它只是\n弹出200EMA在34美元，它使其在53美元的50MA的方式。\n这些价格之间有很大的差距，NIO可能会在40美元之间反弹\n和44元再决定走哪条路。\n\n有牛有熊...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"NIO測試200MA，恐跌穿10月支撐位","the_new_excerpt":"NIO現在正處於一個非常有趣和危險的拐點。它只是\n彈出200EMA在34美元，它使其在53美元的50MA的方式。\n這些價格之間有很大的差距，NIO可能會在40美元之間反彈\n和44元再決定走哪條路。\n\n有牛有熊...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m2cwjy","excerpt":"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is exploring how it can meet rising customer demand to\nown and invest in bitcoin, while still staying on the right side of regulation,\nbank President and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron said on Wednesday.\n\n“Client demand is rising,” Waldron said. “We are regulated on…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m2cwjy/goldman_sachs_coo_reports_clients_demand_for/","title":"Goldman Sachs COO Reports Clients’ Demand for Bitcoin is Rising","date":"March 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"高盛首席运营官报告称客户对比特币的需求正在上升。","the_new_excerpt":"高盛集团（Goldman Sachs Group Inc.）正在探索如何满足客户日益增长的需求，以实现。\n拥有和投资比特币，同时还能保持在监管的正确性。\n银行总裁兼首席运营官John Waldron周三表示。\n\n\"客户需求正在上升，\"Waldron说。\"我们是在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"高盛首席運營官報告稱客戶對比特幣的需求正在上升。","the_new_excerpt":"高盛集團（Goldman Sachs Group Inc.）正在探索如何滿足客戶日益增長的需求，以實現。\n擁有和投資比特幣，同時還能保持在監管的正確性。\n銀行總裁兼首席運營官John Waldron週三表示。\n\n\"客戶需求正在上升，\"Waldron說。\"我們是在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m2gmse","excerpt":"Cathie bought 560k shares on the first day.
