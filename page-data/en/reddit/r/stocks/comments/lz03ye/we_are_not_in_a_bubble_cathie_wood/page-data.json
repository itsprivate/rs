Cathie contends that she sees the recent volatility as a gift to gain alpha over the intended 15% return in many of her high conviction names.</p>\n\n<p>She mentions that at Ark, they have a five year time horizon, and it is counter productive to compare its performance with a benchmark (like the s&amp;p) over a shorter period. She further adds that many stocks in traditional indices today are a potential value trap, and that ark etfs “are a good hedge against broad based benchmarks.”</p>\n\n<p>She reiterates that “we are not in a bubble” – and that the seeds of their 5 innovation platforms were planted in the dot com bubble, and are now ready for prime time, in a period of reality. Fear of a bubble likely stems from benchmark sensitivity and backward looking institutional investors. Furthermore, intuitions should be worried about their own strategies as “creative disruption will impact nearly 50% of the s&amp;p500”.</p>\n\n<p>To Cathie, interest rates going up suggest that ‘real growth is going to pick up’ – and that she understands the concern over her own stock picks potentially underperforming as a result. However, she believes that that the market has assumed that interest rates will stabilize at a 4 to 5% range - which inversed (1/4 or 1/5) gives a normalized p/e of 20 or 25; so markets didn’t actually misprice assets to begin with. She thinks that nominal growth however, will not be at 4 to 5%, but instead around 2-3%, which can lead to greater valuation support for companies that can grow more rapidly.</p>\n\n<p>Rotation from growth to value was also expected on her part. She repeats that value will face massive headwinds going forward. Energy and financial stocks have done amazing in the past month - which is a good thing as the bull market is broadening out unlike the dot com bubble, where ‘too much capital chased too few opportunities, too soon’. Energy and financial sectors booming will likely be short lived as they are both ripe for massive disruption.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lz03ye/we_are_not_in_a_bubble_cathie_wood/","title":"“We are not in a bubble” – Cathie Wood","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-06T13:21:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-06 13:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lz03ye","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lz03ye/we_are_not_in_a_bubble_cathie_wood/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lz03ye/we_are_not_in_a_bubble_cathie_wood/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ShubhamG77","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ShubhamG77","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ShubhamG77","score":782,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"\"我们不是在泡沫中\"----Cathie Wood。","the_new_excerpt":"以下是我总结的Cathie Wood对近期市场的看法。\n波动性，正如她在方舟投资YouTube频道的最新视频中介绍的那样。\n(约42分钟)--我强烈建议你去看看。\n\n进入方舟投资组合的股票的最低预期收益率是15%。\nCAGR。Cathie...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"我們不是在泡沫中\"----Cathie Wood。","the_new_excerpt":"以下是我總結的Cathie Wood對近期市場的看法。\n波動性，正如她在方舟投資YouTube頻道的最新視頻中介紹的那樣。\n(約42分鐘)--我強烈建議你去看看。\n\n進入方舟投資組合的股票的最低預期收益率是15%。\nCAGR。Cathie...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lysdir","excerpt":"ROBLOX (RBLX) IPO FOR MARCH 10TH, 2021\n\n> Disclaimer: I am relatively new to trading and did this DD writeup to help me\n> learn.
