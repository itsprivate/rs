I get excited when I have new cash to add to my investment accounts, and I think I would benefit from holding 10-20 percent of my portfolio in cash for sustained periods of time. </li>\n<li>not obsessively looking at stock prices (for those of us who are long term investors rather than active day traders). It felt pretty good ignoring my investment accounts for the last two weeks.</li>\n<li>asking whether any sector, stock, or market-wide corrections alter the investment thesis associated with any of my stock/etf purchases.
