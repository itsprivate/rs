On the surface of course I agreed that, yes, I absolutely believe in Gamestop and the video games industry as a whole--but it wasn&#39;t until I started really thinking about how directly involved the company has been in my life throughout the years. This is a long personal retrospective so feel free to skip this post if you&#39;re just looking for DD.</p>\n\n<p>When I was a kid <del>in Bulgaria lul</del>  I had a pretty neglected upbringing, living in a shared house with my mom and grandparents I basically only had the &quot;get beaten when I fucked up at school&quot; treatment and never got permission to have friends over or to go out and spend my days doing stuff other than just sit at home. My best friends were my Gameboy and Playstation (couldn&#39;t afford newer consoles until I saved up for a GBA), and when Pokemon Emerald dropped, for months I hounded my mom to take me to Gamestop to pick up a copy. After I finally got it I worked out a deal with her where, after we moved into her coworker&#39;s guest house and I had a little more freedom, I could spend the time to walk to Gamestop after school since it was closer to home and meant she could stay later at work to pick me up there. After getting my first shitty gaming PC, I practically lived out of that neighborhood Gamestop--Halo, Morrowind, Oblivion; I love movies even more than I love games and once upon a time Gamestop had a pretty substantial offering of DVD&#39;s and those garbage Playstation Portable UMD&#39;s, so I ate out on shit like Advent Children or Dodgeball or The Matrix. I probably spent every penny of my allowance in that one brick and mortar Gamestop between the years of 2004 and 2007.</p>\n\n<p>Turned 15, my mom decided she didn&#39;t want me around anymore, sent me to live with my dad who is, by all accounts, clinically insane. Spent my high school years even more isolated than I was as a kid, living in a house in the middle of the rural countryside with no company but a crazy man who, when he got bored, would bust into my room and beat on me for a while. My escape? Hitching rides with a buddy who I met through my uncle and was twice my age whenever he&#39;d visit the Gamestop in the town 30 miles north. Eventually I started spending more time at his place than at home, pounding out Borderlands and Left 4 Dead and Halo 3, buying up stacks of games every weekend and returning whichever ones we finished in only a day or two while keeping the really great ones.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually my dad kicked me out, and I was homeless in the middle of hillbilly country, with no possessions in the world other than a backpack with some clothes, my laptop and my Xbox 360. I won&#39;t go into specifics but I made some pretty hard choices about what I was willing to do in order to earn some money to get back home to my mom and I met more than my fair share of adults willing to take favors from a 17 year old in exchange for some traveling money.  The deeds done, I finally bought myself a bus ticket back to my homestate, (literally) kicked in the door to my mom&#39;s house where she&#39;d remarried and started working shitty fast food jobs till I could afford my own apartment.</p>\n\n<p>Years past. I was growing up faster and faster, still no friends, no real prospects, no car, nothing but a studio apartment, a minimum wage job and--you guessed it--weekends prowling the aisles at Gamestop. I started going to midnight releases of games just for fun and to meet new people, I read every issue of GameInformer back to back throughout each month till the next issue came (fun fact: I was the guy who leaked the first ever screenshots of Skyrim because they fucked up and mailed me a working print of the next month&#39;s issue several weeks too early, woops), and again all of my income was funneled directly into video games. Sure I was shitty about how I spent my money, but no one ever took the time to explain to me what credit was or what a good spending vs. savings strategy was, so I just let Gamestop make those decisions for me.</p>\n\n<p>Joined the Navy. Started making more money than I knew what to do with, and living in the barracks I decided I wasn&#39;t gonna waste time buying cars or trying to pick up girls at the local bars when off duty, so I just...bought more video games. Took a bus over the bridge from Coronado Island to downtown San Diego every Saturday morning to wander around in the shopping districts where, invariably, there would be a Gamestop at the heart of it. I ate good food, watched every new movie, and took the bus back to base every evening with a fat Gamestop bag of goodies.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually I left the Navy, moved to Texas, and after being broke and alone in an apartment again, the company that hired me the same day I applied? Gamestop. I took a position in their refurbishing warehouse in Grapevine and spent 10-12 hour overnight workdays just fixing up mobile devices. It was a trash work environment, but of all the trash jobs I&#39;ve had, the thing that they did differently: I never felt threatened over getting fired if I didn&#39;t work hard enough, and I never felt like I was working for a company I didn&#39;t believe in. When my  mom got her cancer diagnosis it was no trouble at all for them to set me up with an exit as nicely as any company I&#39;ve ever had to leave, and afterwards I never regretted working there because--hey, at the end of the day, it was still Gamestop.</p>\n\n<p>Years later, I have a decent but still not-great job, and I&#39;m still broke, I spend all my time streaming video games, and here comes this news about how GME stock is gonna upend the stock market. I don&#39;t think twice. I spend a paycheck on 13 shares at 114 before it drops back down to 40 in February, and I don&#39;t look back. Now I&#39;m holding on for dear life--I missed my rent payment this month, first time in history; I&#39;m buried in debt I&#39;ve been carrying since high school; I have no worldly possessions in my apartment other than my clothes, my gaming PC, and the consoles I picked up from Gamestop over the years. Nobody is taking these shares away from me, and I end up getting evicted and on the street again because I decided it was a better use of my money to invest in the company that has been there for me when my own family and the rest of the world wasn&#39;t during the hardest times of my life...I&#39;ll consider it the cost of doing business.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not good with money. I&#39;ve never had real friends.But I like Gamestop. I like the stock. I believe I made the right choice investing, and there&#39;s nothing that this decision could do to me that I&#39;ll come to regret that I haven&#39;t already been through ten times over in my life before now.There isn&#39;t another corporate entity in existence I could say the same thing about, and the fact that it&#39;s Gamestop of all possible companies that these hedge funds got caught trying to buttfuck and is about to take care of me yet again heading into this new decade is the most beautiful, personal irony I could ever imagine seeing in my lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>üíéüôè</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I should address this here, some people have been DMing me and posting in the comments below that they&#39;d like to help out with my rent--some would like to chip in a little, one or two people have said they&#39;d like to cover it themselves; I have not accepted any money from anyone as of this edit and I did not write this to be a begging post. I am not in a position to turn down help if people are willing but I would be a hypocrite to ask anyone for any amount, so instead I&#39;ll just say if anyone would like to DM each other to talk about it then DM me once there&#39;s been some deliberation then be my guest, but I am someone who always pays their own way--failing that, I always pay back my debts.  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: Thanks for all the awards and upvotes; honestly I expected this post to be blasted into downvote hell because it contains no useful investment info but it&#39;s legitimately motivating and uplifting to me that so many people could make me feel seen. I&#39;m not selling, I don&#39;t know how to sell, so neither should you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzuwwm/the_universe_has_been_telling_me_to_hold_gme_my/","title":"The Universe has been telling me to hold GME my entire life.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-08T01:57:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-08 01:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lzuwwm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzuwwm/the_universe_has_been_telling_me_to_hold_gme_my/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzuwwm/the_universe_has_been_telling_me_to_hold_gme_my/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Lonan27","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lonan27","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Lonan27","score":1595,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ÂÆáÂÆô‰∏ÄÁõ¥Âú®ÂëäËØâÊàëÔºåÊàë‰∏ÄÁîüÈÉΩË¶ÅÊåÅÊúâGME„ÄÇ","the_new_excerpt":"Ëá™‰ªéÊàë‰∏ÄËÑöË∑≥ËøõWSBÁöÑÁñØÁãÇËÉ°ÊâØÂêéÔºåÊàëËä±‰∫Ü‰∏Ä‰∫õÊó∂Èó¥\nÂèçÊÄù‰∏Ä‰∏ãÔºåÊó†ËÆ∫Êï∞Â≠óÊúâÂ§öÂ•ΩÔºå‰Ω†ÈÉΩÂ∫îËØ•ÊúâËøôÊ†∑ÁöÑÊÑüÊÇü„ÄÇ\nÂè™ÊúâÂΩì‰Ω†Áõ∏‰ø°ÂÖ¨Âè∏ÁöÑÂü∫Êú¨Èù¢Êó∂Êâç‰ºöÊäïËµÑ„ÄÇ‰ªéË°®Èù¢‰∏äÁúã\nÊàëÂΩìÁÑ∂ÂêåÊÑèÔºåÊòØÁöÑÔºåÊàëÁªùÂØπÁõ∏‰ø°GamestopÂíå... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ÂÆáÂÆô‰∏ÄÁõ¥Âú®ÂëäË®¥ÊàëÔºåÊàë‰∏ÄÁîüÈÉΩË¶ÅÊåÅÊúâGME„ÄÇ","the_new_excerpt":"Ëá™ÂæûÊàë‰∏ÄËÖ≥Ë∑≥ÈÄ≤WSBÁöÑÁòãÁãÇËÉ°ÊâØÂæåÔºåÊàëËä±‰∫Ü‰∏Ä‰∫õÊôÇÈñì\nÂèçÊÄù‰∏Ä‰∏ãÔºåÁÑ°Ë´ñÊï∏Â≠óÊúâÂ§öÂ•ΩÔºå‰Ω†ÈÉΩÊáâË©≤ÊúâÈÄôÊ®£ÁöÑÊÑüÊÇü„ÄÇ\nÂè™ÊúâÁï∂‰Ω†Áõ∏‰ø°ÂÖ¨Âè∏ÁöÑÂü∫Êú¨Èù¢ÊôÇÁ∫îÊúÉÊäïË≥á„ÄÇÂæûË°®Èù¢‰∏äÁúã\nÊàëÁï∂ÁÑ∂ÂêåÊÑèÔºåÊòØÁöÑÔºåÊàëÁµïÂ∞çÁõ∏‰ø°GamestopÂíå... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1368689065697161229","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1368689065697161229","title":"Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott marries Seattle school teacher https://t.co/4E7VjrhBFR","date":"March 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"‰∫ø‰∏áÂØåÁøÅÊÖàÂñÑÂÆ∂È∫¶ËÇØÈΩê-ÊñØÁßëÁâπ‰∏éË•øÈõÖÂõæÂ≠¶Ê†°ÊïôÂ∏àÁªìÂ©ö https://t.co/4E7VjrhBFR„ÄÇ","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"ÂÑÑËê¨ÂØåÁøÅÊÖàÂñÑÂÆ∂È∫•ËÇØÈΩä-ÊñØÁßëÁâπËàáË•øÈõÖÂúñÂ≠∏Ê†°ÊïôÂ∏´ÁµêÂ©ö https://t.co/4E7VjrhBFR„ÄÇ","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m00gqa","excerpt":"Hey my fellow apes,\n\nI bought into GME high.
