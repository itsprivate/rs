But I wanted to explain a few things with the ultimate aim, that you dont need to do read any more DD but rather can do your own DD. As most of you cant read anyways, Ill put a TLDR with symbols at the bottom. So here we go.</p>\n\n<h1>General squezze theory (I know a lot of words but reading will make you a big brain ü¶ç)</h1>\n\n<p>There are two types of squezzes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>short squezze</li>\n<li>gamma squezze</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Short squezzes:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Evil Hedgefunds and MMs sell a stock, which they dont have, in hope they can buy it back cheaper. Now price goes up --&gt; Hedgefunds have to cover to cut their losses. Otherwise there is the risk of unlimited loss, as stock price can go up infinitely. If they wait to long they get margin called, because their broker is in fear that they cant cover anymore. And no one wants to get <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9v5e9/that_margin_call_notification_at_3am/\">margin called</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gamma squezzes:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Evil MMs (and others) sell far OTM call options. Now price goes up and suddenly those options are ITM. MMs now have to buy the stock to cover their sold options making the price surge once again bringing new formely OTM options ITM, which then again leads to the price surging. This feedback loop is called a gamma squezze. For this to happen you need to have high numbers of OTM option sold at certain strike prices. Just enough, that the next strike price is reached. It is more likely that lower strike prices are reached. MMs know that, hence they have already hedged some of there sold OTM options with these lower strike prices. This is called Delta Hedging. That means you need higher number of OTM options with lower strike prices then of those with higher strike prices to keep the Squezze going.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to go even deeper I suggest you look at <a href=\"/u/Natural_Profession_8\">u/Natural_Profession_8</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/\">post</a>. He also did a formula, which you can use to calculate how to have the biggest leverage with option buying, meaning forcing MMs to buy the most shares with the purchase of option with a certain strike price.</p>\n\n<p>What you always need to keep in mind for both kinds of squezze that the price run up to trigger the squezze has to be rather fast. Otherwise, there is more time to cover shorts or hedge options and hence having less effect on the price.</p>\n\n<h1>Applying this to the current GME situation</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Short squezze:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Im sorry to say that, but I dont think a squezze solely because of shorts covering will be happening any time soon. You have all seen how the short interest has dropped tremendously from the previous legendary 226%<sup>1</sup> within the last to reporting dates to now 60%<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>1: 01/14/21,</sup> <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME\"><sup>Yahoo Finance</sup></a> <sup>with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares</sup></p>\n\n<p><sup>2: 02/11/21,</sup> <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME\"><sup>Yahoo Finance</sup></a> <sup>with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares</sup></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;But there was no volume?&quot;.</em> Just look at the numbers. GME had a average Volume of 40.49M per day over the last three months. As a stock with roughly 70M shares outstanding thats a lot.<sup>3</sup> AMZN had a 3 months average volume of 3.73M per day with roughly 7x the shares outstanding of GME.<sup>4</sup> There was enough volume.</p>\n\n<p><sup>3:</sup>  <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME\"><sup>Yahoo Finance</sup></a></p>\n\n<p><sup>4:</sup>  <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/key-statistics?p=AMZN\"><sup>Yahoo Finance</sup></a></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;But what is with the institutional ownership?&quot;</em> You all probably all seen these posts, where its said &quot;Institutions solely hold xTimes Outstanding shares of GME. So there has to be massive short interest.&quot; (e. g. see <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz77ix/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra/\">here</a>). But what most of these Posts are missing, that there often reporting delays in between ownership filing, which is causing these high numbers. If you compare it again to AMZN, you also have institutions owning 1.5x of shares outstanding. With a company called Russell Investments Group, LLC owning over 80% of AMZN shares.<sup>5</sup> That should show you, that these FINRA numbers arent correct all the time. Especially with high volumes like in GME, there are a lot of Duplicates because of reporting delays.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5:</sup> <a href=\"https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000000B7\"><sup>Finra</sup></a><sup>, Tab: Shareholders</sup></p>\n\n<p>With that being said, the amount of GME shares hold by Institutions still seems suspiciously high to me. And there are other things like the reported 111% Short interest in XRT<sup>6</sup> or the still abnormally high Short interest in GME. That means remaining shorts could still be a nice catalyst for a possible gamma squezze.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6:</sup> <a href=\"https://etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/\"><sup>Etf channel</sup></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gamma squezze:</strong></p>\n\n<p>A gamma squezze, often underestimated compared to his brother the short squezze. But I think this was the main reason for the surge in January and the surge last week. Especially last week was probably a well set up and executed option chain by big whales.</p>\n\n<p><em>So how can ü¶çü¶çü¶ç profit from a gamma squezze?</em> Just take a look at the current option chains. <a href=\"/u/indonesian_activist\">u/indonesian_activist</a> did a great <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxkeg0/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator/\">excel sheet</a>, where you can see how many shares MMs have to buy if GME reaches a certain price. Just type in the current price and the projected price.</p>\n\n<p><sup>Note: I did update his excel sheet with the new data, which you can find</sup> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZYGIff3Iq7UNyo88SVevj32rcYs0oqlS/view?usp=sharing\"><sup>here</sup></a><sup>. Also I added, an option on the cover, so that you can decide which Option expiring dates you want to include.</sup></p>\n\n<p><em>But how many shares are enough to cause a gamma squeeze?</em> This is really hard to say, but according to <a href=\"/u/CoastalHotDog835\">u/CoastalHotDog835</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lycj6f/gme_dd_part_2_taking_a_look_at_the_0603_calls/\">post</a>. Last weeks surge had the following option volumes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So these are probably numbers we need to see again.</p>\n\n<p><sup>Note: These are just two Strike prices. I can not say how much other options with other strike prices e. g. 100$ played a role nor do I know how high their volume was. Unluckily most sites dont have data for the past.</sup></p>\n\n<p><em>So whats the current situation with GME options?</em></p>\n\n<p>For the options expiring the coming week, we need to have at least a doubling of the price to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls.</p>\n\n<p><sup>Note: It is not fully sufficient compare these two numbers. On the one hand in the excel there are shares already hedged deducted, which decreases the numbers of shares. On the other hand there are not only options included with the projected strike price but all options. I hope, in the absense of better numbers for the option volumes of last week as already stated above, that these two effects could equalize each other.</sup></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jm8qjkjveml61.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541ebeaac563fad9fa536ba770d98f0566acc967\">Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 300$ for options expiring 03/12</a></p>\n\n<p>But for the week after that it looks a lot better. Only a price of 190$ would be needed to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls. This is only a value increase of roughly 40%, which is very well possible. Especially if we really have some big whales on our side like, what is seeming to be the case.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0rtacqi7fml61.png?width=1474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da36500a6dc4406d36a091a687b722d22b40cccb\">Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 190$ for options expiring 03/19</a></p>\n\n<p>I may be adding some more analysis thoughts later. But I will wait with that until I know people are actually reading this.</p>\n\n<p>And of course no financial advice!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Someone in the comments has pointed out that I actually misspelled Squeeze. Sorry for that. So you see Im also just an ü¶ç, who cant write.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR: If GME 190$ until 03/19--&gt;ü¶çü¶çü¶ç on üåï üöÄüöÄüöÄ</strong> <strong><sup>(possibly</sup>)</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzsnlk/gme_squezze_dd_moon_soon_possibly/","title":"GME SQUEZZE DD MOON SOON (possibly)","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-07T20:22:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-07 20:22","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lzsnlk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzsnlk/gme_squezze_dd_moon_soon_possibly/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzsnlk/gme_squezze_dd_moon_soon_possibly/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a3493dedbabed68d15d63888f37945dedec7d2af","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"_Dicio","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_Dicio","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"_Dicio","score":2942,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME SQUEZZE DD MOON(ÂèØËÉΩ)","the_new_excerpt":"Êó©‰∏äÂ•ΩÔºå‰∏ãÂçàÂ•ΩÔºåÊôö‰∏äÂ•ΩÔºåÊàëÁöÑÂêåËÉû‰ª¨Âú®Âë®Âõ¥ÁöÑÂº±Êô∫„ÄÇ\nÁöÑ‰∏ñÁïå„ÄÇ\n\nÊàëÁü•ÈÅì‰Ω†‰ª¨ÂæàÂ§ö‰∫∫ÈÉΩÊòØËøôÊ†∑ÁöÑ\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k77i69/wsb_reading_citron_reports/]\nÂ¶ÇÊûúËØ¥Âà∞ËØªDD„ÄÇ‰ΩÜÊàëÊÉ≥Ë∑üÂ§ßÂÆ∂Ëß£Èáä‰∏Ä‰∏ã„ÄÇ\nÁªàÊûÅÁõÆÊ†áÔºåÂç≥","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME SQUEZZE DD MOON(ÂèØËÉΩ)","the_new_excerpt":"Êó©‰∏äÂ•ΩÔºå‰∏ãÂçàÂ•ΩÔºåÊôö‰∏äÂ•ΩÔºåÊàëÁöÑÂêåËÉûÂÄëÂú®Âë®ÂúçÁöÑÂº±Êô∫„ÄÇ\nÁöÑ‰∏ñÁïå„ÄÇ\n\nÊàëÁü•ÈÅì‰Ω†ÂÄëÂæàÂ§ö‰∫∫ÈÉΩÊòØÈÄôÊ®£ÁöÑ\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k77i69/wsb_reading_citron_reports/]\nÂ¶ÇÊûúË™™Âà∞ËÆÄDD„ÄÇ‰ΩÜÊàëÊÉ≥Ë∑üÂ§ßÂÆ∂Ëß£Èáã‰∏Ä‰∏ã„ÄÇ\nÁµÇÊ•µÁõÆÊ®ôÔºåÂç≥","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lzt88b","excerpt":"The current administration is discussing a few proposals for a tax on financial\ntransactions.
