If I close a buy order, the stock usually goes down, the same way for a sell order, when I sell usually goes up. So I was thinking very hard on this, how could this binary outcome be so hard to achieve? Well, I invented a new way to build your portfolio so you will be 100% safe, I call it the B.R.T (Bait Retard Trades).</p>\n\n<p>BRT - How does it work?</p>\n\n<p>You will not do trading any different, you will continue to do your stupid trades, but this time you will use only up to 30% of your portfolio on your own trading ideas, and the other 70% you will use to perform the exact opposite. Warning! This will only work if you are honest with yourself, you should really think about what you think is best to use with your 30%, don&#39;t cheat and think the opposite just to use that on the 70%, you must trust the fact that you are actually retarded and don&#39;t know what you are doing, therefore the opposite position of your genuine choice will be the best. For example, last week I was thinking about getting some calls on PLTR that expires in a week, for many reasons I thought this was the best decision, so I did 30% of calls on PLTR and 70% on puts, made some money on the fact that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. Being retarded gives you a superpower, you ALWAYS have the answer, it&#39;s just not what you think it is, it&#39;s the exact opposite.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m082y7/literally_free_money_applied_mathematics_to_build/","title":"Literally FREE MONEY!
