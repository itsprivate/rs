Over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is what I did:</strong> Pulled the option chain data into excel, ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a gamma squeeze:</strong> For those who don&#39;t know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief ELi5. Gamma squeezes revolve around options, I wont go into too much detail here on what those are, but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is. Contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per. Option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers, biggest of whom being option houses out of Chicago. They have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming ITM (in the money) of course, the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low. These market makers thought GME was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds GME @ $15 goes to $150... Market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge, which of course will cause that price to rise more and more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now that GME is @ $130:</strong> Today was a great day, GME closed up $8.17 or 6.58% maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for, but on a down market day is pretty incredible. Now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait.. </p>\n\n<h1>GME Options Exp. 2021-03-05 (This Friday)</h1>\n\n<p><strong>GME @ $100 (Last Fridays Close, Option Expiry):</strong> At this level going into Friday we could expect <strong>22,427</strong> in open interest in ITM GME contracts this week. That sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised. About <strong>2,242,700</strong> to be exact or about <strong>4.97%</strong> of the TOTAL FLOAT. Crazy. </p>\n\n<p><strong>GME @ $130:</strong> We can expect <strong>35,989</strong> contracts to be ITM if tomorrow closes above $130. A solid <strong>13,562</strong> more contracts than at the $100 level. This equates to <strong>3,598,900</strong> shares or <strong>7.97%</strong> of total float. Now we&#39;re getting nutty.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What about GME @ $150:</strong> Closing Friday above this level brings thousands more contracts ITM. In fact, closing above this price means there would be <strong>46,397</strong> contracts ITM. This means that a whopping <strong>4,639,700</strong> shares or <strong>10.27%</strong> of total float. <strong>MORE THAN DOUBLE @ $100</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong> Well not every contract will be exercised, even ITM. These market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well. But its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised, <strong>10%</strong> of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand, it means more contracts will come ITM next week, and then more again the week after and so on. With the steady price rise we&#39;ve been seeing, it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge, COULD is operative and this is entirely speculation. What we do know is that MASSIVE amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in GME. There&#39;s been crazy volume at times, particularly today, the day before contract expiry. Any how, ill put away my tinfoil hat. What we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning, the first domino&#39;s. </p>\n\n<p>Does this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond? No not really, but it sure does increase the odds of that happening. We probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves. We all saw what happened with RH, and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took, its just the action that we were able to see. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Since last Friday (2021-02-26, last option expiry) the number of contracts possibly ITM has <strong>DOUBLED</strong> I repeat <strong>DOUBLED.</strong> If tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised <strong>10%</strong> of total float will be called on. Even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close @ $130 there is still <strong>50%</strong> more contracts ITM than last week. All of this continues to build that snowball that&#39;s started to get mighty big. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Ill say it again for those in the back <strong><em>DOUBLED</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mic drop. </p>\n\n<p>Not financial advice, this is just for fun.</p>\n\n<p>Any questions feel free to ask away!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxwhpy/gme_possibility_of_gamma_squeeze_just_went/","title":"GME - POSSIBILITY OF GAMMA SQUEEZE JUST WENT THROUGH THE ROOF","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T01:55:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 01:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lxwhpy","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxwhpy/gme_possibility_of_gamma_squeeze_just_went/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxwhpy/gme_possibility_of_gamma_squeeze_just_went/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"yodisc","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/yodisc","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"yodisc","score":18517,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"如同在讨论主题中所承诺的那样，我将发布一些最新的信息，关于什么是\n周五可能带来的ITM选项方面。\n\nTL;DR的数量可能的合同ITM可能是两倍上周到期。\n超过400万股可以调用这些行使的选项，只有增加\n对不断...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"如同在討論主題中所承諾的那樣，我將發佈一些最新的信息，關於什麼是\n週五可能帶來的ITM選項方面。\n\nTL;DR的數量可能的合同ITM可能是兩倍上週到期。\n超過400萬股可以調用這些行使的選項，只有增加\n對不斷...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lxpxli","excerpt":"So all you new traders talked about how these companies do not have enough\n\"gains.\" Look at it now.
