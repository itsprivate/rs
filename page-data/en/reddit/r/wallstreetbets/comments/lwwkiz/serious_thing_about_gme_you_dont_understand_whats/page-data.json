No space mission has taken less than a month to plan, like ever. These things take time. What is so beautiful to me is how a group of average people have banded together, Wall street is SCARED of us. We did not &quot;Manipulate the market&quot;, we rallied for a common cause, some of us lost money, some gained. You see the problem is that, the government has always been scared of us, because like ants, there is strength in numbers... </p>\n\n<p>Our Autist asses are making HISTORY... One day when Elon Musks Grandkids are studying at Harvard school of Business they&#39;ll be talking about the great movement on Wall street from 2021, DFV will be there, Wallstreetbets will be there, And each and every single one of you, will have partaken in a true moment in History.</p>\n\n<p>This could not have been accomplished without you smooth brained apes. Let&#39;s not stop here, Wallstreet is scared, The Hedgies are getting their asses chewed by the Wall and Old Money.</p>\n\n<p>A bright young man once said - I like the stock... Let&#39;s show these graduate mofos what a bunch of Apes can do. Grab your bananas boys, We&#39;re taking off amd We&#39;re never coming back home 🚀🦍🍌🌌</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Not financial advice, I like the stock, Making History, Wall street scared, Apes together strong, Something about space and rockets, Limit 1 banana per carry-on</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwwkiz/serious_thing_about_gme_you_dont_understand_whats/","title":"Serious thing about $GME, you don't understand what's going on here...","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T03:33:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 03:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwwkiz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwwkiz/serious_thing_about_gme_you_dont_understand_whats/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwwkiz/serious_thing_about_gme_you_dont_understand_whats/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"IfItsBrokenFixIt","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/IfItsBrokenFixIt","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"IfItsBrokenFixIt","score":2563,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"关于GME的严肃事情，你不明白这是怎么回事... ...","the_new_excerpt":"伙计们，这枚火箭就像SpaceX的助推器一样，它们离太空很近，但。\n总会回到地面... 它的上限... 猩猩没有月亮...\n\n开玩笑的，你这个娘娘腔纸片手，你他妈怎么敢同意... ...\n我的声明！？\n\n伙计们，我们正在执行一项任务... ... 没有太空任务...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於GME的嚴肅事情，你不明白這是怎麼回事... ...","the_new_excerpt":"夥計們，這枚火箭就像SpaceX的助推器一樣，它們離太空很近，但。\n總會回到地面... 它的上限... 猩猩沒有月亮...\n\n開玩笑的，你這個娘娘腔紙片手，你他媽怎麼敢同意... ...\n我的聲明！？\n\n夥計們，我們正在執行一項任務... ... 沒有太空任務...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lwkvn7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwkvn7/no_rkt_for_us_gme_tards/","title":"no RKT for us GME tards","date":"March 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我们GME tards没有RKT","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們GME tards沒有RKT","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lx4e56","excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/hertz-the-original-meme-stock-is-turning-out-to-be-worthless\n\nTL;DR: Hertz is probably the original meme-stock from last year.
