All day I&#39;ve seen a news article on yahoo with the title &quot;Trader arrested as Gamestop soars&quot; . I know because I clicked the article about 20 times. I was confused as it was just a story about a Japanese guy getting arrested years ago. I kept clicking the story thinking something was bugged. But now after market closes the title has changed. To how the gamestop situation echoes a situation years ago when someone was arrested. The intent is clear. Scare people away from GME. It reeks of desperation. They&#39;re grasping at straws.
