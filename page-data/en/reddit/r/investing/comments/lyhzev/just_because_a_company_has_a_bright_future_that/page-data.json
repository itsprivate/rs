All these posts always seem to ignore valuation and they rarely make an effort to justify the valuations of the companies they preach. It’s easy so say that a company will grow sales 25% year over year for the next decade, but if the company trades a 100x P/S then what good is it? The market has already priced in the high growth of these companies. You cannot make money betting on something already priced in. In order to think the stock is a good investment, you have to expect it to grow more than what the market currently expects. A lot of people don’t seem to make that connection. They just say “company do good = stock go up.” I have no doubt that all these hyper growth stocks like TSLA will be much larger in 10 years than they are today. That doesn’t make it a good investment because the market is already expecting absurdly high growth and so that is factored into the stock price. Many companies grew substantially over a certain period of time despite their stock suffering. An easy example is Microsoft in 1999. Was Microsoft a better company in 2009 than in 1999? Microsoft had revenue that was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999. Despite this, the stock was down over 50% during that timeframe. The simple fact is that it doesn’t matter how great a company is if you overpay for that company. Keep that in mind the next time you are analyzing hyper growth stocks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lyhzev/just_because_a_company_has_a_bright_future_that/","title":"Just because a company has a bright future, that doesn’t make it a good investment.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T19:48:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 19:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lyhzev","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lyhzev/just_because_a_company_has_a_bright_future_that/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lyhzev/just_because_a_company_has_a_bright_future_that/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Michael12390","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Michael12390","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Michael12390","score":3527,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"一家公司有光明的未来，并不代表它就是好的投资。","the_new_excerpt":"我在这里经常看到有人在这里发DD帖，说下一个大公司和\n为什么他们未来会有这么好的发展。所有这些职位似乎总是\n忽略了估值，他们很少努力证明其估值的合理性。\n他们所宣扬的公司。这很容易，所以说，一个公司...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一家公司有光明的未來，並不代表它就是好的投資。","the_new_excerpt":"我在這裏經常看到有人在這裏發DD帖，說下一個大公司和\n爲什麼他們未來會有這麼好的發展。所有這些職位似乎總是\n忽略了估值，他們很少努力證明其估值的合理性。\n他們所宣揚的公司。這很容易，所以說，一個公司...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1367875442628263940","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367875442628263940","title":"\"Hi mom, margin is on the phone and they would like to speak with you.\"\n\n-Liam, Robinhood trader since April 2020","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"\"嗨，妈妈，保证金在电话里，他们想和你谈谈。\"\n\n-Liam，Robinhood交易员，自2020年4月起。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"\"嗨，媽媽，保證金在電話裏，他們想和你談談。\"\n\n-Liam，Robinhood交易員，自2020年4月起。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ly92v9","excerpt":"The familiar \"Rate My Portfolio\" sticky can be found here.\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Arate+my+portfolio&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome traders who just can't help…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ly92v9/rstocks_daily_thread_on_meme_stocks_friday_mar_05/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Thread on Meme Stocks Friday - Mar 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks每日主题：Meme Stocks周五--2021年3月5日。","the_new_excerpt":"熟悉的 \"给我的投资组合评分 \"贴纸可以在这里找到。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Arate+my+portfolio&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n欢迎那些只是忍不住的贸易商...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/Stocks每日主題：Meme Stocks週五--2021年3月5日。","the_new_excerpt":"熟悉的 \"給我的投資組合評分 \"貼紙可以在這裏找到。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Arate+my+portfolio&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n歡迎那些只是忍不住的貿易商...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lyhzev","previousId":"TweetPost-1367875442628263940","nextId":"RedditPost-ly92v9","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lyhzev/just_because_a_company_has_a_bright_future_that/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
