There has been 7 stock market crashes since 1950, averaging one every 10 years. </p>\n\n<p>The stock market crashes ranges from inflation (10%+), to oil price rises (4x) due to war, dot com bubble, housing market collapse, covid-19 etc.</p>\n\n<p>The graph is a log graph meaning that the space changes are proportional to the percentage change. This is useful for looking at long term charts since the % change for a dollar increase is smaller as the index value goes up.</p>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 has averaged a compound annual growth rate of 8.22% since 1950. This is illustrated by the trend lines, and as you can see the S&amp;P 500 is trading right in the middle of the range (the two blue trend lines). </p>\n\n<p>I noted a few reasons in the box for each crash for a brief understanding of why it had happened. Note, that the only one with a &#39;fear of overvaluation&#39; was only the dotcom crash where the PE&#39;s were over 200 and many companies were just cash burning shells with massive negative free cash flows.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying a crash / correction won&#39;t happen, but i just wanted to put things into perspective and give a bigger picture of the overall stock market since pretty much before all of us were born. </p>\n\n<p>By no means am i an economist but I didn&#39;t include anything earlier than 1950s because that was pre WW2/WW1 - before the US was a superpower / the global financial hub / USD = world trade currency etc.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: some of you noted that its only 8.22% if you bought at the start but I want to clarify that yes and no! Yes for the people that literally buy in once once at the beginning of 1950.</p>\n\n<p>No because if you buy throughout the years (DCA every month let&#39;s say) you&#39;ll buy within the range - both lower and higher range! So it&#39;s more or less 8%! For example during 1960s-1980s the sp500 traded sideways! So if you constantly bought in those 20 years, the accumulation of money in this period would have a higher CAGR of &gt; 8% because of where it is in the range. Just follow the lines! It makes it easier. There&#39;s roughly same amount of periods above and below the middle trend line.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/","title":"S&P 500 since 1950 - graph showing all crashes","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-28T17:36:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-28 17:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lujnvo","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Semcast","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Semcast","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Semcast","score":4177,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"标准普尔500指数自1950年以来 - 显示所有崩溃的图表","the_new_excerpt":"标准普尔500指数自1950年以来--7次崩溃 [https://www.tradingview.com/x/zu8ej35I/]\n\n嗨，伙计们只是想把事情的角度为大家，因为你们中的一些人。\n似乎对最近一周的股票走势相当紧张。\n\n我总结了一份1950年以来的所有股灾名单。已经有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"標準普爾500指數自1950年以來 - 顯示所有崩潰的圖表","the_new_excerpt":"標準普爾500指數自1950年以來--7次崩潰 [https://www.tradingview.com/x/zu8ej35I/]\n\n嗨，夥計們只是想把事情的角度爲大家，因爲你們中的一些人。\n似乎對最近一週的股票走勢相當緊張。\n\n我總結了一份1950年以來的所有股災名單。已經有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltz2lb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltz2lb/i_didnt_eat_yesterday_so_i_could_make_this_melvin/","title":"I didn't eat yesterday so I could make this, \"Melvin Capital needs tough love\" gg APES GO BLASTOFF","date":"February 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我昨天没吃饭，所以可以做这个，\"梅尔文资本需要强硬的爱 \"gg APES GO BLASTOFF。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我昨天沒喫飯，所以可以做這個，\"梅爾文資本需要強硬的愛 \"gg APES GO BLASTOFF。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-luef1v","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luef1v/i_made_this_for_the_first_squeeze_but_never/","title":"I made this for the first squeeze but never posted, let's squeeze this again","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 28, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"第一次挤的时候我就做了这个，但一直没发，我们再挤一次吧。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"第一次擠的時候我就做了這個，但一直沒發，我們再擠一次吧。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lujnvo","previousId":"RedditPost-ltz2lb","nextId":"RedditPost-luef1v","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
