So, at the current quote of slightly above $350, their market cap is $44 Billion</li>\n<li><p>2020 revenue was $1.778 Billion, up 57.5 % over 2019  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Player (hardware) revenue was $510 M, up 31.6 % YoY (good number)</li>\n<li>Platform revenue was $1.27 B, up 71.1 % YoY (excellent number)</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>Gross margins were 45.45% up 158 basis points YoY  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Player (HW) margins were 8.55% up 414 bps YoY</li>\n<li>Platform (SW) margins were 60.3% down 413 bps YoY</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>Number of shares were up 7.6 % YoY</p></li>\n<li><p>Op-ex was up 47.9 % (S&amp;M 67 %, G&amp;A 48.8 %, R&amp;D 34.25 %), all YoY</p></li>\n<li><p>They do not use much leverage, current portion of LTD is below $100M</p></li>\n<li><p>Cash position of a little over a billion dollars</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So,  &quot;player&quot; is their foot in the door, but &quot;platform&quot; is where they make  money. Most of ROKU&#39;s platforms are not in the premium segment, but  found in the value Smart TV segment</p>\n\n<p>ROKU&#39;s  current market share is a tad shy of 10% of the ~300M Smart TVs sold in  2020, and ROKU claims a 33% market share in the USA</p>\n\n<p><em>I got into this wanting to trash ROKU. Instead, I &quot;see&quot; what they are accomplishing,</em> <strong><em>with the exception of earning money (net income)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Valuation Method: Look at HW and SW separately</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A $510M HW company with a 32 % growth rate, and 8.5% gross margins. Hard to value at over 2x sales. So, let&#39;s call it $1 Billion</li>\n<li>A  $1.27 Billion SW company with 60% gross margins, and a 71% growth rate.  This is harder to put a firm number on, but anywhere from 10x to 20x  sales. So, $12.7 B to $25 B</li>\n<li>Add them up, and I get a range of $14 B to $26 B, or a stock price between $113 to $209</li>\n<li>For reference, Morningstar&#39;s FVE estimate is $150 with a high degree of uncertainty</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion: ROKU is seriously overvalued at the current &quot;depressed&quot; quote of $350+/share.</strong> <em>My valuation metrics are &quot;more than generous&quot;.</em> <strong><em>This is not financial advice</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000156459021009021/roku-10k_20201231.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000156459021009021/roku-10k_20201231.htm</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lzxjoo/roku_dd_based_on_the_latest_sec_10k/","title":"ROKU DD based on the latest SEC 10K","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-07T22:08:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-07 22:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lzxjoo","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lzxjoo/roku_dd_based_on_the_latest_sec_10k/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lzxjoo/roku_dd_based_on_the_latest_sec_10k/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"bapcha","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bapcha","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bapcha","score":141,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"根据证监会最新的10K，ROKU DD。","the_new_excerpt":"由于有一些关于ARKK的讨论，以及事实上，我不希望\n碰了TSLA，我想，为什么不试试ROKU呢？\n\n我很喜欢Roku的产品--我家里有一台流媒体播放器，公司经营得很好。\n大多时候（我的BIL在那里工作过一段时间)\n\n 1. 他们有1.24亿股出....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"根據證監會最新的10K，ROKU DD。","the_new_excerpt":"由於有一些關於ARKK的討論，以及事實上，我不希望\n碰了TSLA，我想，爲什麼不試試ROKU呢？\n\n我很喜歡Roku的產品--我家裏有一臺流媒體播放器，公司經營得很好。\n大多時候（我的BIL在那裏工作過一段時間)\n\n 1. 他們有1.24億股出....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lzw0pn","excerpt":"Vanguard added $BB on 6 different portfolios of theirs and also is the\nthird-largest shareholder of $TSLA.\nSource:\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-purchases-57-m-tesla-213302038.html\nProfiles of the shares added\nVTMGX https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTMGX\nVPCCX…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/","title":"Vanguard is bullish on $BB","date":"March 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Vanguard看好$BB。","the_new_excerpt":"Vanguard在其6个不同的投资组合上增加了$BB，也是他们的\n$TSLA的第三大股东。\n来源\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-purchases-57-m-tesla-213302038.html\n新增股份的概况\nVTMGX https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTMGX\nVPCCX...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Vanguard看好$BB。","the_new_excerpt":"Vanguard在其6個不同的投資組合上增加了$BB，也是他們的\n$TSLA的第三大股東。\n來源\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-purchases-57-m-tesla-213302038.html\n新增股份的概況\nVTMGX https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTMGX\nVPCCX...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lzue8o","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzue8o/i_dont_think_my_strategy_of_buying_at_the_peak/","title":"I don’t think my strategy of buying at the peak and selling at the bottom is working, also I might just be retarded","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 07, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我觉得我在最高点买入，在最低点卖出的策略并不奏效，也可能是我智障了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我覺得我在最高點買入，在最低點賣出的策略並不奏效，也可能是我智障了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lzxjoo","previousId":"RedditPost-lzw0pn","nextId":"RedditPost-lzue8o","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lzxjoo/roku_dd_based_on_the_latest_sec_10k/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
