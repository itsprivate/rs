Something about investors won&#39;t buy it unless it has a higher interest rate because fear of inflation. Now that we&#39;re on the verge of signing in a 1.9 trillion stimulus bill, I have a some questions about the effect on the bond market.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When does the US treasury sell the 1.9 trillion in bonds to pay for it?</li>\n<li>Does it do it in one massive sale? What types of bonds does it sell (2 year, 5 year, 10 year)?</li>\n<li>If bonds are already selling poorly, then wouldn&#39;t a massive influx of bonds on the market make the yield situation even worse?</li>\n<li>Are investors/banks prepared to buy it all up? Or will the federal reserve step in and buy the remainder?</li>\n<li>Is it therefore possible that the signing of the stimulus will actually hurt stocks in the short term due to bond market/yield fluctuations?</li>\n<li>Can anyone explain what happened with US treasury/bonds during the 2 trillion stimulus last year? Or the 900 billion stimulus earlier this year?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thanks for any insight guys!
