When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple,” wrote the veteran investor.</p>\n\n<p>The cost for acquiring that stake was $36 billion and since then Berkshire has enjoyed regular dividends averaging about $775 million annually and has pocketed an extra $11 billion in 2020 by selling a small part of its holdings.</p>\n\n<p>The continuous repurchase of shares by Apple and the consequent shrinking number of shares outstanding has meant that Berkshire now owns 5.4% of the Tim Cook-led company. “That increase was costless to us,” wrote Buffett.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Berkshire’s third-quarter operating profits declined 32% to $5.48 billion from $8.07 billion a year ago. The company <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/20/11/18260772/berkshire-hathaway-reports-q3-earnings-record-9-3b-stock-buyback?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\">repurchased .3 billion worth of stock</a> in the period.</p>\n\n<p>Since Berkshire also repurchased its own shares during the past two and a half years, its shareholders now own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than they did in July 2018, wrote Buffett.</p>\n\n<p>“This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future,” revealed the Oracle of Omaha.</p>\n\n<p>Buffett also pointed to Apple’s publicly stated intention to repurchase shares and thus Berkshire shareholders would find “their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.”</p>\n\n<p>This year the Buffet-led company <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/21/02/19694882/warren-buffetts-berkshire-cuts-apple-stake-and-buys-these-drugmaker-telecom-stocks-instead?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\">cut its position in Apple</a> by 6% to 887 million shares in the latest quarter but upped stakes in <strong>AbbVie Inc</strong> (NYSE: <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ABBV\">ABBV</a>), <strong>Bristol-Myers Squibb Company</strong> (NYSE: <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BMY\">BMY</a>), and <strong>Merck &amp; Co</strong>, Inc (NYSE: <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MRK\">MRK</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Apple still remains the single largest investment in Berkshire’s portfolio.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong> Berkshire Class A shares closed nearly 0.9% lower at $364,580 on Friday. On the same day, the company’s Class B shares closed 1.3% lower at $240.51. Apple shares closed almost 0.2% higher at $121.26 and fell 0.41% in the after-hours session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shivdeep Dhaliwal</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mon, March 1, 2021, 1:28 AM·2 min read</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lw3v1m/warren_buffett_says_berkshires_apple_investment/","title":"Warren Buffett Says Berkshire's Apple Investment Shows The 'Power Of Repurchases'","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T17:22:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 17:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lw3v1m","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lw3v1m/warren_buffett_says_berkshires_apple_investment/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lw3v1m/warren_buffett_says_berkshires_apple_investment/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"folkwoodswest","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/folkwoodswest","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"folkwoodswest","score":240,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"巴菲特称伯克希尔的苹果投资显示了 \"回购的力量","the_new_excerpt":"伯克希尔-哈撒韦公司（NYSE: BRK-A [http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BRK-A]）（NYSE:\nBRK-B [http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BRK-B]) 首席执行官巴菲特在周末\n年书\n[https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/02/19897750/warren-buffett-in-annual-letter-signals-more-stock-buybacks...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"巴菲特稱伯克希爾的蘋果投資顯示了 \"回購的力量","the_new_excerpt":"伯克希爾-哈撒韋公司（NYSE: BRK-A [http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BRK-A]）（NYSE:\nBRK-B [http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BRK-B]) 首席執行官巴菲特在週末\n年書\n[https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/02/19897750/warren-buffett-in-annual-letter-signals-more-stock-buybacks...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1366744479135391744","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366744479135391744","title":"President Biden will announce later Tuesday that Merck &amp; Co. will help make Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-shot COVID-19 vaccine in an unusual agreement between two competitors that could lead to a significant boost in supply, the Washington Post reported. $JNJ https://t.co/avxTv8aJLI https://t.co/2dAorcqFix","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"据华盛顿邮报报道，总统拜登将在周二晚些时候宣布，默克公司将帮助生产强生公司的一针COVID-19疫苗，这是两个竞争对手之间的一项不同寻常的协议，可能会导致供应量大幅增加。$JNJ https://t.co/avxTv8aJLI https://t.co/2dAorcqFix","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"據華盛頓郵報報道，總統拜登將在週二晚些時候宣佈，默克公司將幫助生產強生公司的一針COVID-19疫苗，這是兩個競爭對手之間的一項不同尋常的協議，可能會導致供應量大幅增加。$JNJ https://t.co/avxTv8aJLI https://t.co/2dAorcqFix","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lw34hk","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw34hk/when_you_claim_to_be_the_hero_of_retail_investors/","title":"When you claim to be the hero of retail investors but you’re really a villain.....😒","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当你口口声声说自己是散户的英雄，但其实是个小人.....😒。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當你口口聲聲說自己是散戶的英雄，但其實是個小人.....😒。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lw3v1m","previousId":"TweetPost-1366744479135391744","nextId":"RedditPost-lw34hk","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lw3v1m/warren_buffett_says_berkshires_apple_investment/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
