Along with going public. They&#39;ve announced a new medium-lift reusable rocket and plans for human launch capabilities. The CEO, Peter Beck, once said he&#39;d eat his hat if Rocketlab ever made bigger rockets, persued reusablity, went public, or tried to launch humans. Well they are doing them all at once, so he must be pretty confident.</p>\n\n<p>Rocketlab&#39;s Electron rocket has a great record in the small rocket world, but there is so much that still remains to be seen about their new rocket, the Neutron. I assume it will be using an entirely new engine architecture, and probably will not use electric turbo pumps like their current Rutherford engines. It also seems like they are dropping their use of carbon fiber based on the shiny pictures.</p>\n\n<p>Then, beyond the rocket science, there is the business side of things. How will they plan to compete with SpaceX and Blue Origin who each have their own satellite constellations? (Or plans anyways for Blue Origin.) Is there room enough in the growing space industry for another medium-lift launcher? Perhaps if Rocket Lab can beat Blue Origin&#39;s New Glen to space. I can think it could definitely happen?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvb8qc/rocketlab_to_go_public_via_spac_merger/","title":"Rocketlab to go public via SPAC merger","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T19:19:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 19:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvb8qc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvb8qc/rocketlab_to_go_public_via_spac_merger/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvb8qc/rocketlab_to_go_public_via_spac_merger/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"CylonBunny","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/CylonBunny","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"CylonBunny","score":122,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Rocketlab将通过SPAC合并上市","the_new_excerpt":"鉴于目前前面的文章，觉得这个特别有意思。\n本分册关于SPAC合并的页面。\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/rocket-lab-nears-deal-to-merge-with-vector-spac-11614556800?mod=hp_lista_pos5]\n\n这是我对第一家上市的太空公司感到兴奋。随着...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Rocketlab將通過SPAC合併上市","the_new_excerpt":"鑑於目前前面的文章，覺得這個特別有意思。\n本分冊關於SPAC合併的頁面。\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/rocket-lab-nears-deal-to-merge-with-vector-spac-11614556800?mod=hp_lista_pos5]\n\n這是我對第一家上市的太空公司感到興奮。隨着...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lvb2cn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb2cn/when_in_doubt_zoom_out/","title":"When in doubt ZOOM OUT","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当有疑问时，请放大","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當有疑問時，請放大","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lvb407","excerpt":"So $RKT CEO Jay Farner fuckin hates shorts almost as much as we do, and im going\nto outline what this absolute CHAD has planned for them.\n\nHis company RKT mortgage literally smashes every ER by a country mile and hes\ntired of his stock being held down by these spineless cowards.
