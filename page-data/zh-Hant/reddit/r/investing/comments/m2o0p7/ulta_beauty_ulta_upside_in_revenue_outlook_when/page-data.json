I&#39;m long &amp; leaning towards a double digit upswing for reasons below:\nConsensus revenue expectation is $2.1 billion which means yoy declines in both total sales &amp; same-store sales. What if the numbers are better than expected? Obviously there are bulls expecting a beat but what if (pardon my language here) the Q4 revenue beat beats expectations? </p>\n\n<p>REASONS for the &quot;beat beat&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with these internal facts: 1.ULTA makes 32% of its annual revenue in Q4. 2. ULTA current ytd revenue is only half of full year revenue for the previous year? Do you see where I&#39;m going with this? Ulta&#39;s Q4 revenue for this year should be higher as customers haven&#39;t shopped that much ytd. (Relative to historical annual spend) ULTA will beat based on restocking and holiday splurges.</p>\n\n<p>Now consider this scenario: you are Patrick Bateman and buy your cosmetics and skincare from ULTA Beauty. There&#39;s a pandemic in 2020 so you slow down on shopping because you can&#39;t risk catching covid in the store. As the year goes, you start ordering a few things online but not as much as you did in store (in person) pre-pandemic. However by Q4 you have WFH fatigue and you&#39;re now ready to restock all your face creams, shower gel and makeup. Gotta show Paul Allen you&#39;re still the MVP. You decide to order some essentials online plus it&#39;s Christmas so you add some extras. You then realize that you&#39;ve only spent half of what you normally spend at ULTA so you also get Evelyn an ULTA voucher. </p>\n\n<p>Next we look at Sephora&#39;s numbers to test the beat beat view. Context: Sephora is owned by LVMH and is ULTA&#39;s main competitor. Sephora only sells the fancy beauty (Think Dior &amp; Estee Lauder) the high-life nothing cheap. </p>\n\n<p>Two things to note on these numbers:\nFirstly, Sephora&#39;s numbers are reported in the Selective Retailing Section of LVMH results. Selective Retailing combines Sephora with LVMH&#39;s travel retailers (e.g DFS - which you see at the airport).\nSecondly, there&#39;s a date mismatch, Sephora year end is Dec vs Jan for ULTA, so ULTA quarters are a month ahead. </p>\n\n<p>LVMH reported a recovery in selective retailing from a low of -38% in Q2 to -26% in Q4 in it&#39;s 2020 annual results. Now -26% sounds bad but LVMH&#39;s travel retailers account for the bulk of the decline. No travel = no revenue for DFS. Travel retail accounts for 20-35% of division revenue so adjusting for the collapse in travel leads to improved metrics for Sephora. This means SEPHORA IS BACK! IT&#39;S RECOVERED TO PRE PANDEMIC REVENUE. Sephora revenue is global but makes a good read-through for the US market. </p>\n\n<p>While we&#39;re on Sephora as an ULTA long I&#39;m not sleeping well since Sephora announced a store arrangement with Kohl&#39;s which will be a long term headache for ULTA. Kohl&#39;s unlike JCPenney (RIP) has locations in US strip malls which is Ulta&#39;s niche. </p>\n\n<p>LVMH&#39;s numbers IMO offer the best peer comparison despite their opacity. It&#39;s tempting to compare ULTA with general beauty sales data but ULTA has historically had low correlation to general retail data and 2020 just made general data even less useful. When large stores like Macys and other department stores report lower sales this counts for most of the decline in market data which makes it hard to assess smaller players like ULTA. This increases the uncertainty in the Q4 revenue number. Good setup for option opportunities but I excluded trades as my DD on the &quot;beat beat&quot; view.
