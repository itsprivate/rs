I think $6 to $100 is range of valuation. Deep thoughts below.</p>\n\n<p>Is AppHarvest the anti-Monsanto? What is $APPH worth? Can company get to $10 billion valuation within 5 years. DISCLOSURE I OWN 20,000 of $APPHW which is warrants.</p>\n\n<p>Ever since AppHarvest was announced as a SPAC I got intrigued with not just the company but agtech or in this case vertical farming, to be more specific. I do think this is not a fad and a necessary way of life for the next 100 years. My only concern is if there really is a competitive advantage in regards to tech. Many claim to have good tech but none have proven this at scale with hundreds of millions pounds of a product being grown and distributed and more importantly profitable. </p>\n\n<p>I think there are major trends we need to consider and food resources has definitely been a major problem and will continue for decades. The Chinese have been securing food supply buying companies all over the world such as pork, beef and others. They own so many supply chains, raw material companies, ports, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Usually when you have a new sector (although not new in Europe as the dutch have been working on vertical greenhouse farming for decades). First is the growth and hype, then there is business reality (growth but growing losses and continued capital needs) and then there is consolidation from all the players that mismanaged their funds or made a poor strategic decisions. Then there is profitability or economies of scale from all the consolidation, more mature phase. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, although there is some hype with Appharvest today I begin to think with my venture capital hat....what is the real value of this company today and how big can it really get over the next 5 years? Who are the best comps when compared to new agtech or pioneering (think beyond meat).</p>\n\n<p>If you read the article below you can see all of the future products that the company will be producing over the next 5 years. All they talk about today is tomatoes and leafy greens but they will also do fruits, other veggies and something that is not even mentioned is cannabis. This is because Kentucky has not legalized it but when they do I am sure the company would be the first to get the license. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fooddive.com/news/can-giant-greenhouses-help-feed-consumers-appharvest-wants-to-find-out/553570/\">https://www.fooddive.com/news/can-giant-greenhouses-help-feed-consumers-appharvest-wants-to-find-out/553570/</a></p>\n\n<p>This article explains all the potential products and services too.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.verticalfarming.com/food-crops/\">https://www.verticalfarming.com/food-crops/</a></p>\n\n<p>The company claims that their farming does about 30x better yield than a convention farm but when I looked at conventional farm yield and those from vertical farms in Netherlands they claim to do more than even well established vertical farms that do about 7x traditional farms. If they do 30x the rate of a regular farm then I believe the revenue estimates provided by the company to actually be conservative. </p>\n\n<p>Below is what I believe the company can do in revenues. </p>\n\n<p>2021 revenues is $25 to $40 million\n2022 revenues is $60mm to $100mm\n2023 revenues is $150 to $200mm\n2024 revenues is $250 to $350mm\n2025 is $400mm or more</p>\n\n<p>If you look at beyond meat historical valuation they traded at 10x to 20x revenues given their growth rate. That would imply the following valuation for AppHarvest.</p>\n\n<p>2021 would be $600 mm marketcap at 20x revenues given year 2 will be 300% growth. </p>\n\n<p>2022 would be $1 to $1.5 billion when using $75mm as revenue and 18x revenue. </p>\n\n<p>2023 would be $2.6 billion as it would be 15x revenue at $175mm in revenues. </p>\n\n<p>2024 would be $4.5 billion as it would be 15x $300mm in revenues.</p>\n\n<p>2025 would be $7.5 billion at 15x revenues and $500mm of revenues.</p>\n\n<p>There are so many variables as to what this valuation would be on a price per share basis because I do expect a debt or equity raise by 2022 or 2023, better 2022 as maybe terms would be better and not on desperate terms.</p>\n\n<p>It all depends how much cash flow they can generate but each farm costs about $1.5 to $2 million an acre and if they plan to add about 100 acres of land every year they need $150mm to $200mm a year to keep growing. Given the $465mm of cash they got from the SPAC is now $330mm after the $125mm purchase of their first farm. They basically have enough capital for 100 to 150 acres....this is where it gets interesting because what will the company do? My bet or educated guess is that the PR machine will kick into high gear for the next year. </p>\n\n<p>I do have concerns or questions such as: Will the growth and perhaps hype help them fund more growth? The company will not have enough operating Cash flow to build a 60 acre farm a year until the company reaches at least  $300 to $400mm in revenues at the very least. So, that means that from today to that day they will need at least another $500mm to $1 billion in capital to keep growing and not be concerned with growth via cash flow.  That means they will either need to do a few small raises or one really large one. </p>\n\n<p>So, what has to happen in order for the company to be able to generate more buzz than just selling tomatoes? The only thing I can think of is that the company starts producing products that are higher revenues and margin per acre and the only way I can see that is via cannabis or other medicinal products. You see, just like Amazon where people saw it as a book store in the 1990’s it is way different today. With AppHarvest it really can be the next Monsanto was taken private by Bayer at a pretty high multiple too. </p>\n\n<p>Today you are paying $1.3 billion enterprise value for the business of which all of the cash js going to go for salaries and land acquisition of farms (building and construction). </p>\n\n<p>So, what are shares worth?  </p>\n\n<p>Well given enterprise to revenue multiples you could argue that trough valuation would be $6 to $10 and assuming no equity raise and the same share count by 2025 that would be $75 to $100 a share. With a current price of $17 dollars it could drop 50% or go up close to 500%.  Although I believe they will need more capital probably they will keep raising $50mm to $100mm a year to keep growth momentum going. </p>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts on this?  What am I missing from the story that is good or bad?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lz1sxs/appharvest_deep_thoughts_worth_6_or_100_apph_and/","title":"AppHarvest deep thoughts.
