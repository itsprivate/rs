I had the pleasure (before Covid) of having a job that took me all over the US. I&#39;ve worked in TX, ND, WY, OK, COL.</p>\n\n<p>And you know what I found?? Everyone was generally fucking nice, not just Canadians...Sorry lol. I loved being around the locals, always happy to lend a hand, tell me directions and of course, make fun of my retarded prime minister haha... </p>\n\n<p>This tells me something, when we all change our lives after this, I know that you won&#39;t be just changing YOUR life! You will be changing the lives of people around you as well, even if it&#39;s not direct.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I will be donating to my local animal shelter, well because I LOVE DAGS, DAGS are my fav. \n(For you weird cat people, guess they are OK as well) \nThen, I&#39;ll be ordering consoles from the GameStop in Wyoming (where I was supposed to move for work before the plug was pulled lol) and literally shipping it here (I know there is EB Games, shush, I do what I want) and donating them to the children&#39;s hospital.</p>\n\n<p>Now, do you think these Billionaires are doing even the slightest of these things!? No!! They instead take children to private islands and rape them. They evade taxes, they cheat on their wives, they spit on the little guys. It&#39;s an absolute fucking joke. </p>\n\n<p>The world needs more of us. And with a few extra $$, we will change alot of lives. </p>\n\n<p>Let me know what your charity dreams are! It feels good to read positive dreams over HF toxic trash bull shit. </p>\n\n<p>Love you all. To infinity and beyond!! </p>\n\n<p>🦍💪, 💎🙌💎, 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I can&#39;t even comment on my own post.. 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️</p>\n\n<p>Listens, IDGAF if your a sour patch cunt, if your here to ONLY make money for yourself and yourself only, good for you lol. I never said the world is ONLY filled with good people lol, this was meant to just give a good feeling for once. \nMoney does change people, so be a person that changes for good, don&#39;t be a fuckin Karen. </p>\n\n<p>Have a good feeling in your life for once ffs lol. </p>\n\n<p>See ya on the moon retards.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT EDIT: Holy Shit!! What an amazing amount of responses!!! Thank you so much for the awards! Wow! \nGood way to show the salty ones here they&#39;re wrong. Now, stop buying me awards and use it towards $GME and your Charity Dream!!! \nAll you all (y&#39;all) lol, pouring in and responding, I&#39;m reading them all and upvoting, your responses are beautiful. </p>\n\n<p>For the analytical ones: don&#39;t even know why I have to say this, I am completely aware millions x millions is not a billion.
