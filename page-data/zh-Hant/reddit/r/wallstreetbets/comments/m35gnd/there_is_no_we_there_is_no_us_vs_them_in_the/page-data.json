Don’t let anyone tell you when you should or should not buy. Don’t let anyone tell you when you should or should not sell. It is your money and your decision. 3 weeks ago when GameStop touched back down to $40 I was talked out of going all in. It is my money and I should do what I want with it. If you decide you want to sell GameStop next time it touches $280 or $300 then sell, it is your money. Don’t listen to people here telling you that they are counting on you to hold to stick it to the hedge funds. Trading/investing is a one man game. No one here is going to support you if you go broke so don’t go broke listening to what other people tell you is the right thing to do.
