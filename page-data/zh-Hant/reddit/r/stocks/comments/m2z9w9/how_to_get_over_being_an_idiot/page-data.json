I have been watching AMD for a while, I build PCs and think they are generally hugely undervalued, so I wanted to get in on this. But then I sold them on Friday and bought GME options for the &#39;squeeze&#39; instead. My logic was that even if there is only a 20% chance of GME hitting 1k, I will be massively rich from that, to the point that it was worth risking the nearly &quot;sure thing&quot;(I saw it as maybe 90% that it would print in the next month, not this quickly though) of AMD.</p>\n\n<p>The AMD options have gone from the 50 cents I bought them up to 2.50 per share...I basically lost out on 4k so far( a lot for me, I invest 100/week on a tight budget mostly as a hobby) and my GME options are tanking. Now, after doing more research, I think the squeeze is bullshit and I just FOMOed in, convincing myself in the moment that it was a rational decision. I am regretting this so much :(. I have a feeling like I missed out on a good opportunity I will never have again(even though of course there will be other plays, I hate this feeling so much)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m2z9w9/how_to_get_over_being_an_idiot/","title":"How to get over being an idiot?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-11T23:27:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-11 23:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m2z9w9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2z9w9/how_to_get_over_being_an_idiot/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2z9w9/how_to_get_over_being_an_idiot/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"mmarco90","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mmarco90","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"mmarco90","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如何克服自己是个白痴？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我上周买了20个AMD期权(.50美分/股)，2021年5月95美元的行使权，当。\nAMD一直处于底部。我观察AMD已经有一段时间了，我是造PC和\n认为他们的价值普遍被大大低估了，所以我想参与其中。但是\n然后我在周五卖掉了它们，并买入了GME期权，以...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何克服自己是個白癡？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我上週買了20個AMD期權(.50美分/股)，2021年5月95美元的行使權，當。\nAMD一直處於底部。我觀察AMD已經有一段時間了，我是造PC和\n認爲他們的價值普遍被大大低估了，所以我想參與其中。但是\n然後我在週五賣掉了它們，並買入了GME期權，以...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m2efv8","excerpt":"I want to genuinely hear how fun today was for you apes that are balls deep with\nme in $GME.
