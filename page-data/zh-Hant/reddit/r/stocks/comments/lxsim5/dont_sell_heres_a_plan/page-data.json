You have the right to be sad. Don&#39;t let anyone on the internet denounce your feelings. We&#39;re all in the same boat. I am down 25% and it fucking stings. Some of you might, like myself, have thought about selling. Don&#39;t. It&#39;s too late. This was a very harsh correction but things are looking bright. Don&#39;t buy the dip. Wait. Let SPY hit $370-371. And it will. We broke all the major support levels and next up is $370-371. If we go lower, which we probably won&#39;t, then brace yourself for another downfall. But if we stay there, buy good companies. If you can, hedge your positions.</p>\n\n<p>Let the market cool off until you buy anything. 10-year yields went higher after the Powell interview and it can potentially go even higher. </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully we&#39;ll leave this behind us, being even better investors/traders.
