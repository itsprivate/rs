Market participants are encouraged after President Biden signed into law a new coronavirus relief package. Treasury yields also steadied at 1.525% at the time of writing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.3% up, the SPY closed 1% up, and the Dow closed 0.62% up.</p>\n\n<p>After months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization&#39;s formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. </p>\n\n<p>Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote of the bill “The most immediate impact in the macroeconomic data will be in retail sales numbers, where some of the $410 billion in direct payments will appear in both the March and — especially — April reports.”</p>\n\n<p>The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. The cyclical energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&amp;P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\">Labor Department&#39;s Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a> on Tuesday showed core consumer prices increased less than expected in February.{prices paid by consumers rose only 1.3% in February over last year, coming in below the 1.4% increase expected and slowing from the prior month. While it may not seem like a lot, the report helps quell fears that as economic activity increased and more stimulus was unleashed into the economy, inflationary pressures would begin to materialize. This also suggests the Federal Reserve can maintain its accommodative monetary policy and avoid rising interest rates for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. job openings increased to nearly seven million in January,<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm\"> rising to the highest level since February 2020 as job postings picked up following a pandemic-induced slump.</a></li>\n<li>The Department of Labor released its weekly report on new jobless claims \n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial jobless claim:</strong> 712,000 vs. 725,000 expected and a revised 754,000 during the prior week</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Continuing claims:</strong> 4.144 million vs. 4.200 million expected and a revised 4.337 million during the prior week</li>\n<li>Antitrust regulators in China are mulling the imposition of a fine of over $975 million on Alibaba, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.</li>\n<li>Shares of General Electric Co. took another dive Thursday, putting them on track to suffer the biggest decline in more than 11 months, as analysts gave a mixed review of the company’s Analyst Day and GECAS deal.
