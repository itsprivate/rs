I have also seen many people think that stocks will go up a lot because the price is &quot;relatively&quot; cheap and has room to grow. For example, I recently read a Reddit Post where the author said that they believe TSM will easily go to a price of $500-600. However, the market cap is already 591 billion meaning they expect they will be more valuable than Amazon or Apple. I am not saying this is not true, but market cap is extremely important to take into consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Apple&#39;s current price is $121.26 and Enphase&#39;s price is $176.06. Does this mean Enphase is the more valuable company? No. </p>\n\n<p>A company with a smaller cap has more room to grow than companies with bigger market caps regardless of the price they trade at. For example, it is more feasible that a 1 billion dollar company grows 10X than a company with a market cap of 50 billion to grow to 500 billion. </p>\n\n<p>If you think a stock is a good buy, don&#39;t become too fixated on the price and buy it. On the other hand, don&#39; think a stock is a good deal because it is a low price. There could have been massive dilution.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck in picking your next winners!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/luxx2q/price_isnt_everything_look_at_market_cap/","title":"Price Isn't Everything- Look at Market Cap","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T04:05:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 04:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"luxx2q","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/luxx2q/price_isnt_everything_look_at_market_cap/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/luxx2q/price_isnt_everything_look_at_market_cap/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"moneytobemade8","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/moneytobemade8","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"moneytobemade8","score":930,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"价格不是万能的--看市值。","the_new_excerpt":"我见过很多人因为价格太高而不买股票，或者反之。\n反之亦然。我也看到很多人认为股票会涨很多，因为......。\n价格 \"相对 \"便宜，且有发展空间。例如，我最近\n读到一个Reddit帖子，作者说他们相信TSM... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"價格不是萬能的--看市值。","the_new_excerpt":"我見過很多人因爲價格太高而不買股票，或者反之。\n反之亦然。我也看到很多人認爲股票會漲很多，因爲......。\n價格 \"相對 \"便宜，且有發展空間。例如，我最近\n讀到一個Reddit帖子，作者說他們相信TSM... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lumd98","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lumd98/full_autism_took_over_and_decided_to_sell/","title":"Full autism took over, and decided to sell everything to do a weekly call on Mara.
