So first we have to base our value, the company raised 528 million$ from private sources last year at a valuation of 28 billion dollars. It later Ipo&#39;d at a base valuation of 32 billion with 40$ stock price only to rise to 77$ and a market cap of 40.56 billion. The problem with this is Microsoft bought Mojang (so essentially the Minecraft IP) for 2.5 billion  in late 2014 when they had 38 million in revenue which is relatively nothing compared to RBLX now but when we go back in time to just 2017 it (Rblx) had relatively only 45 million in revenue vs Minecraft&#39;s 350 million. Now let&#39;s go to last year when Minecraft had a monthly active user base of 130 million players vs Rblx&#39;s 150 million. It also had 953 million dollars in profit but with 253 million in net losses. Now compare that to Minecraft who had a revenue of 415 million which is up significantly from  the previous years 375 million and it becomes clear that Roblox is very overvalued. Furthermore to show the point we have another Microsoft purchase, this time of Zenimax  Media inc for 7.5 billion $ for properties like TES, DOOM, Fallout, Dishonored, Starfield and many more with a wide variety of studios included like Bethesda, Zenimax, Tango, Arkane (Deathloop), Id and Machine Games . Just in that bundle Doom Eternal (1 game) had revenue of 350 million dollars and Skyrim with lifetime revue of over 620 million. The last showing of this is Sony&#39;s purchase of Insomniac in 2018 for 229 million dollars and since then have created 2 games that have raked in more than the initial investment with Spiderman 2018 and Spiderman MM having brought in approximately 250-270 million $ and with another game in the pipeline with Ratchet and Clank A rift in Time. Final note: EA&#39;s entire market cap which consists of Madden, Battlefield, Fifa ( yearly releases with micro transactions) and many other titles is at 30 billion, Take Two which owns GTA, Red Dead,  NBA 2K and many others and is valued at 20 billion, the thought that Roblox is worth almost more than both these titans combined is insane and nonsensical.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <strong>This is my opinion not advice.</strong> To play devils advocate since a lot of people like the stock here you go: Roblox has doubled it&#39;s earnings every year since 2017 and had record revenue of almost 950 million this past year. It&#39;s player base is also massive and almost doubling every year just like it&#39;s revenue. It also has 500 million in the bank right now and can easily grow by going to Asia and or incorporating more adult themes. Now other than the fact that it&#39;s trading 40x P/S you have to bet that the game will both keep growing and making profits at the same pace as now which I don&#39;t see but here there u go.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/","title":"Roblox is insanely overpriced","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T09:27:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 09:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m3c0lk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Krios625","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Krios625","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Krios625","score":119,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Roblox的价格太高了","the_new_excerpt":"我知道，没有人喜欢熊，而且人们也觉得与此有关。\n股票，因为他们的孩子玩游戏或因为它是一个视频游戏，它的乐趣。\n投资于这些东西，但在处理金钱时，事实胜于感情，因为。\n它没有感情。所以首先我们要根据我们的价值，对...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Roblox的價格太高了","the_new_excerpt":"我知道，沒有人喜歡熊，而且人們也覺得與此有關。\n股票，因爲他們的孩子玩遊戲或因爲它是一個視頻遊戲，它的樂趣。\n投資於這些東西，但在處理金錢時，事實勝於感情，因爲。\n它沒有感情。所以首先我們要根據我們的價值，對...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m3c51v","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3c51v/which_one_of_you_retards_did_this/","title":"Which one of you retards did this?","date":"March 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"是你们哪一个智障做的？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"是你們哪一個智障做的？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1370038844712755201","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1370038844712755201","title":"Gonna tell my kids this is the Mona Lisa https://t.co/kwdV15mmre","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 12, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"要告诉我的孩子这是蒙娜丽莎https://t.co/kwdV15mmre。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"要告訴我的孩子這是蒙娜麗莎https://t.co/kwdV15mmre。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m3c0lk","previousId":"RedditPost-m3c51v","nextId":"TweetPost-1370038844712755201","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
