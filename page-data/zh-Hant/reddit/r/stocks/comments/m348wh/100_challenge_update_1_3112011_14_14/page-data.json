If it does, I am sorry and will take it to the right board. I am a stock market newbie who is sharing my own investment journey in order to inspire others, become better at investing, and encourage healthy discussion.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Max profits off a $100 MAX initial investment. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The rules:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Deposit $100</strong> into a non-Robinhood trading service (I used Webull)</li>\n<li><strong>Make good decisions:</strong> Calculated buying/selling decisions to increase the value of the account.</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#39;t rely on referrals:</strong> Referral bonuses are fine, but shouldn&#39;t count towards gains. </li>\n<li><strong>Post weekly updates</strong> with progress and a rundown of gains, losses, decisions, and takeaways.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why am I doing this:</strong> I&#39;m a novice investor. Like many, I was swept up in the recent meme stock mania. Along the way I realized that I REALLY like diving deep into a company, making an investment, and watching that investment grow over the short term. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Starting Point: 2/26</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Investment $100</li>\n<li>Bought: 14 shares of $ARLO @ $6.99/share\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rationale: I believe personal home security as an industry will grow in popularity over the next few years. From Youtubers posting package thieves to cheaters caught on camera, I think the trend is here to stay.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Update 1 - 3/11/21</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sold: 14 shares of $ARLO @ $8/share (+14% gain)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rationale: Recent <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/10/verkada-hack-surveillance-risk/\">news</a> about security cam hacks has me nervous about the short term for this stock.</li>\n<li>Bought: 7 shared of $FNKO @ $15.50/share</li>\n<li>Rationale: Good market share, positive EPS in Q3 2020, and they beat estimates by a wide margin. They are also reporting earnings this afternoon. I think their products are reasonably priced, popular, and Covid is keeping people indoors, decorating their home offices with small low-priced figurines.
